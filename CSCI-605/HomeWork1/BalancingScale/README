Objective: Designing, implementing, and testing of a simple algorithm.

You have the following weights: 1g, 2g, 5g, 10g, 10g, 25g, 25g, 25g, 50g, and you would to know if you can weigh 30g using a balancing scale.. Write a program which can find out the answer.
•You can use arrays, and you have to use an iterative algorithm.
•You can hardcode all values in your program.
•You cannot use any classes besides the String class.
Your program should only print out: the weights used if a it can be done or no. For example, if using the above weights: 30g yes; used weights = 5g 25g.
