Objective: Designing, implementing, and testing of a simple algorithm.
Given is the following sum:
f∞(x) = ∑-x^i, for i = 0 to ∞

For a given n this can be written as:
fn(x) = ∑-x^i, for i = 0 to n

Write a program which calculates
|fn(0.5) - f∞(0.5)| < delta, delta >0

Requirements:
•you need to print our the approximation of f(x), n, and the last term added.
•your calculation methods signature must be static private void f(double x).
•you can only use: variables of basic types and loops loops.
•you can also not use anything from java.lang.Math.
