Objective: Designing, implementing, and testing of a iterative algorithm based on a recursive definition.
Given is the following recursive definition:
P(0) := 0; for n = 0; 
P(1) := 1; for n = 1; 
P(n) := 2 * P(n-1) + P(n-2); for n ≥ 2
Write a program which calculates f(n) for 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
A possible output for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 could look like:
% java Linear
p(0)   = 0
p(1)   = 1
p(2)   = 2
p(3)   = 5
p(4)   = 12
Requirements:
•You can not use a recursive algorithm
•You can not store more than three values of the sequence at the same time. In other words you can only use 3 variables for the storage of the sequence.
•You can calculate for all k, k ≥ 2, the value P(k) only once.
