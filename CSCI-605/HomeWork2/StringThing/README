Write a program that
•
finds out the character distribution. Upper case and lower case characters have to be treated as the same character.
•
All lines needed ’added together’
•
Find all palindromes. A palindrome may be on two different array entries. For example the following text has
static String[] aText = {
                "ab",
                "bab",
         };
the following palindromes: bb,bab, abba.
