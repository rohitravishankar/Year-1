the genius chapter i this story has its beginnings in the town of alexandria illinois 
between and at the time when the place had a population of somewhere near ten 
thousand there was about it just enough of the air of a city to relieve 
it of the sense of rural life it had one streetcar line a theatre or rather
an opera house so called why no one might say for no opera was ever performed
there two railroads with their stations and a business district composed of four brisk sides to
a public square in the square were the county courthouse and four newspapers these two 
morning and two evening papers made the population fairly aware of the fact that life 
was full of issues local and national and that there were many interesting and varied 
things to do on the edge of town several lakes and a pretty stream perhaps alexandria's
most pleasant feature gave it an atmosphere not un akin to that of a moderate priced summer resort
architecturally the town was not new it was mostly built of wood as all american 
towns were at this time but laid out prettily in some sections with houses that 
sat back in great yards far from the streets with flower beds brick walks and 
green trees as concomitants of a comfortable home life alexandria was a city of young 
americans its spirit was young life was all before almost everybody it was really good 
to be alive in one part of this city there lived a family which in 
its character and composition might well have been considered typically american and middle western it 
was not by any means poor or at least did not consider itself so it was
in no sense rich thomas jefferson witla the father was a sewing machine agent with 
the general agency in that county of one of the best known and best selling 
machines made from each twenty thirtyfive or sixtydollar machine which he sold he took a 
profit of thirtyfive per cent the sale of machines was not great but it was 
enough to yield him nearly two thousand dollars a year and on that he had 
managed to buy a house and lot to furnish it comfortably to send his children 
to school and to maintain a local store on the public square where the latest 
styles of machines were displayed he also took old machines of other makes in exchange 
allowing ten to fifteen dollars on the purchase price of a new machine he also 
repaired machinesand with that peculiar energy of the american mind he tried to do a 
little insurance business in addition his first idea was that his son eugene tennyson witla 
might take charge of this latter work once he became old enough and the insurance 
trade had developed sufficiently he did not know what his son might turn out to 
be but it was always well to have an anchor to windward he was a 
quick wiry active man of no great stature sandyhaired with blue eyes with noticeable eyebrows 
an eagle nose and a rather radiant and ingratiating smile service as a canvassing salesman 
endeavoring to persuade recalcitrant wives and indifferent or conservative husbands to realize that they really 
needed a new machine in their home had taught him caution tact savoir faire he 
knew how to approach people pleasantly his wife thought too much so certainly he was 
honest hard working and thrifty they had been waiting a long time for the day 
when they could say they owned their own home and had a little something laid 
away for emergencies that day had come and life was not half bad their house 
was neatwhite with green shutters surrounded by a yard with well kept flower beds a 
smooth lawn and some few shapely and broad spreading trees there was a front porch 
with rockers a swing under one tree a hammock under another a buggy and several 
canvassing wagons in a nearby stable witla liked dogs so there were two collies mrs 
witla liked live things so there were a canary bird a cat some chickens and 
a bird house set aloft on a pole where a few bluebirds made their home 
it was a nice little place and mr and mrs witla were rather proud of 
it miriam witla was a good wife to her husband a daughter of a hay 
and grain dealer in wooster a small town near alexandria in mclean county she had 
never been farther out into the world than springfield and chicago she had gone to 
springfield as a very young girl to see lincoln buried and once with her husband 
she had gone to the state fair or exposition which was held annually in those 
days on the lake front in chicago she was well preserved good looking poetic under 
a marked outward reserve it was she who had insisted upon naming her only son 
eugene tennyson a tribute at once to a brother eugene and to the celebrated romanticist 
of verse because she had been so impressed with his idylls of the king eugene 
tennyson seemed rather strong to witla père as the name of a middlewestern american boy 
but he loved his wife and gave her her way in most things he rather 
liked the names of sylvia and myrtle with which she had christened the two girls 
all three of the children were good lookingsylvia a girl of twentyone with black hair 
dark eyes full blown like a rose healthy active smiling myrtle was of a less 
vigorous constitution small pale shy but intensely sweetlike the flower she was named after her 
mother said she was inclined to be studious and reflective to read verse and dream 
the young bloods of the high school were all crazy to talk to myrtle and 
to walk with her but they could find no words and she herself did not 
know what to say to them eugene witla was the apple of his family's eye 
younger than either of his two sisters by two years he had straight smooth black 
hair dark almondshaped eyes a straight nose a shapely but not aggressive chin his teeth 
were even and white showing with a curious delicacy when he smiled as if he 
were proud of them he was not very strong to begin with moody and to 
a notable extent artistic because of a weak stomach and a semianæmic condition he did 
not really appear as strong as he was he had emotion fire longings that were 
concealed behind a wall of reserve he was shy proud sensitive and very uncertain of 
himself when at home he lounged about the house reading dickens thackeray scott and poe 
he browsed idly through one book after another wondering about life the great cities appealed 
to him he thought of travel as a wonderful thing in school he read taine 
and gibbon between recitation hours wondering at the luxury and beauty of the great courts 
of the world he cared nothing for grammar nothing for mathematics nothing for botany or 
physics except odd bits here and there curious facts would strike himthe composition of clouds 
the composition of water the chemical elements of the earth he liked to lie in 
the hammock at home spring summer or fall and look at the blue sky showing 
through the trees a soaring buzzard poised in speculative flight held his attention fixedly the 
wonder of a snowy cloud high piled like wool and drifting as an island was 
like a song to him he had wit a keen sense of humor a sense 
of pathos sometimes he thought he would draw sometimes write he had a little talent 
for both he thought but did practically nothing with either he would sketch now and 
then but only fragmentsa small rooftop with smoke curling from a chimney and birds flying 
a bit of water with a willow bending over it and perhaps a boat anchored 
a mill pond with ducks afloat and a boy or woman on the bank he 
really had no great talent for interpretation at this time only an intense sense of 
beauty the beauty of a bird in flight a rose in bloom a tree swaying 
in the windthese held him he would walk the streets of his native town at 
night admiring the brightness of the store windows the sense of youth and enthusiasm that 
went with a crowd the sense of love and comfort and home that spoke through 
the glowing windows of houses set back among trees he admired girlswas mad about thembut 
only about those who were truly beautiful there were two or three in his school 
who reminded him of poetic phrases he had come acrossbeauty like a tightened bow thy 
hyacinth hair thy classic face a dancing shape an image gaybut he could not talk 
to them with ease they were beautiful but so distant he invested them with more 
beauty than they had the beauty was in his own soul but he did not 
know that one girl whose yellow hair lay upon her neck in great yellow braids 
like ripe corn was constantly in his thoughts he worshiped her from afar but she 
never knew she never knew what solemn black eyes burned at her when she was 
not looking she left alexandria her family moving to another town and in time he 
recovered for there is much of beauty but the color of her hair and the 
wonder of her neck stayed with him always there was some plan on the part 
of witla to send these children to college but none of them showed any great 
desire for education they were perhaps wiser than books for they were living in the 
realm of imagination and feeling sylvia longed to be a mother and was married at 
twentyone to henry burgess the son of benjamin c burgess editor of the morning appeal 
there was a baby the first year myrtle was dreaming through algebra and trigonometry wondering 
whether she would teach or get married for the moderate prosperity of the family demanded 
that she do something eugene mooned through his studies learning nothing practical he wrote a 
little but his efforts at sixteen were puerile he drew but there was no one 
to tell him whether there was any merit in the things he did or not 
practical matters were generally without significance to him but he was overawed by the fact 
that the world demanded practical servicebuying and selling like his father clerking in stores running 
big business it was a confusing maze and he wondered even at this age what 
was to become of him he did not object to the kind of work his 
father was doing but it did not interest him for himself he knew it would 
be a pointless dreary way of making a living and as for insurance that was 
equally bad he could hardly bring himself to read through the long rigamarole of specifications 
which each insurance paper itemized there were timesevenings and saturdayswhen he clerked in his father's 
store but it was painful work his mind was not in it as early as 
his twelfth year his father had begun to see that eugene was not cut out 
for business and by the time he was sixteen he was convinced of it from 
the trend of his reading and his percentage marks at school he was equally convinced 
that the boy was not interested in his studies myrtle who was two classes ahead 
of him but sometimes in the same room reported that he dreamed too much he 
was always looking out of the window eugene's experience with girls had not been very 
wide there were those very minor things that occur in early youthgirls whom we furtively 
kiss or who furtively kiss usthe latter had been the case with eugene he had 
no particular interest in any one girl at fourteen he had been picked by a 
little girl at a party as an affinity for the evening at least and in 
a game of postoffice had enjoyed the wonder of a girl's arms around him in 
a dark room and a girl's lips against his but since then there had been 
no reencounter of any kind he had dreamed of love with this one experience as 
a basis but always in a shy distant way he was afraid of girls and 
they to tell the truth were afraid of him they could not make him out 
but in the fall of his seventeenth year eugene came into contact with one girl 
who made a profound impression on him stella appleton was a notably beautiful creature she 
was very fair eugene's own age with very blue eyes and a slender sylphlike body 
she was gay and debonair in an enticing way without really realizing how dangerous she 
was to the average susceptible male heart she liked to flirt with the boys because 
it amused her and not because she cared for anyone in particular there was no 
petty meanness about it however for she thought they were all rather nice the less 
clever appealing to her almost more than the sophisticated she may have liked eugene originally 
because of his shyness he saw her first at the beginning of his last school 
year when she came to the city and entered the second high school class her 
father had come from moline illinois to take a position as manager of a new 
pulley manufactory which was just starting she had quickly become friends with his sister myrtle 
being perhaps attracted by her quiet ways as myrtle was by stella's gaiety one afternoon 
as myrtle and stella were on main street walking home from the post office they 
met eugene who was on his way to visit a boy friend he was really 
bashful and when he saw them approaching he wanted to escape but there was no 
way they saw him and stella approached confidently enough myrtle was anxious to intercept him 
because she had her pretty companion with her you haven't been home have you she 
asked stopping this was her chance to introduce stella eugene couldn't escape miss appleton this 
is my brother eugene stella gave him a sunny encouraging smile and her hand which 
he took gingerly he was plainly nervous i'm not very clean he said apologetically i've 
been helping father fix a buggy oh we don't mind said myrtle where are you 
going over to harry morris's he explained what for we're going for hickory nuts oh 
i wish i had some said stella i'll bring you some he volunteered gallantly she 
smiled again i wish you would she almost proposed that they should be taken along 
but inexperience hindered her eugene was struck with all her charm at once she seemed 
like one of those unattainable creatures who had swum into his ken a little earlier 
and disappeared there was something of the girl with the corncolored hair about her only 
she had been more human less like a dream this girl was fine delicate pink 
like porcelain she was fragile and yet virile he caught his breath but he was 
more or less afraid of her he did not know what she might be thinking 
of him well we're going on to the house said myrtle i'd go along if 
i hadn't promised harry i'd come over oh that's all right replied myrtle we don't 
mind he withdrew feeling that he had made a very poor impression stella's eyes had 
been on him in a very inquiring way she looked after him when he had 
gone isn't he nice she said to myrtle frankly i think so replied myrtle kind 
o' he's too moody though what makes him he isn't very strong i think he 
has a nice smile i'll tell him no please don't you won't will you no 
but he has a nice smile i'll ask you round to the house some evening 
and you can meet him again i'd like to said stella it would be a 
lot of fun come out saturday evening and stay all night he's home then i 
will said stella won't that be fine i believe you like him laughed myrtle i 
think he's awfully nice said stella simply the second meeting happened on saturday evening as 
arranged when he came home from his odd day at his father's insurance office stella 
had come to supper eugene saw her through the open sitting room door as he 
bounded upstairs to change his clothes for he had a fire of youth which no 
sickness of stomach or weakness of lungs could overcome at this age a thrill of 
anticipation ran over his body he took especial pains with his toilet adjusting a red 
tie to a nicety and parting his hair carefully in the middle he came down 
after a while conscious that he had to say something smart worthy of himself or 
she would not see how attractive he was and yet he was fearful as to 
the result when he entered the sitting room she was sitting with his sister before 
an open fireplace the glow of a lamp with a redflowered shade warmly illuminating the 
room it was a commonplace room with its blue clothcovered center table its chairs of 
stereotyped factory design and its bookcase of novels and histories but it was homey and 
the sense of hominess was strong mrs witla was in and out occasionally looking for 
things which appertained to her functions as housemother the father was not home yet he 
would get there by suppertime having been to some outlying town of the county trying 
to sell a machine eugene was indifferent to his presence or absence mr witla had 
a fund of humor which extended to joking with his son and daughters when he 
was feeling good to noting their budding interest in the opposite sex to predicting some 
commonplace climax to their one grand passion when it should come he was fond of 
telling myrtle that she would one day marry a horsedoctor as for eugene he predicted 
a certain elsa brown who his wife said had greasy curls this did not irritate 
either myrtle or eugene it even brought a wry smile to eugene's face for he 
was fond of a jest but he saw his father pretty clearly even at this 
age he saw the smallness of his business the ridiculousness of any such profession having 
any claim on him he never wanted to say anything but there was in him 
a burning opposition to the commonplace a molten pit in a crater of reserve which 
smoked ominously now and then for anyone who could have read neither his father nor 
his mother understood him to them he was a peculiar boy dreamy sickly unwitting as 
yet of what he really wanted oh here you are said myrtle when he came 
in come and sit down stella gave him an enticing smile he walked to the 
mantelpiece and stood there posing he wanted to impress this girl and he did not 
quite know how he was almost lost for anything to say you can't guess what 
we've been doing his sister chirped helpfully wellwhat he replied blankly you ought to guess 
can't you be nice and guess one guess anyhow put in stella toasting popcorn he 
ventured with a half smile you're warm it was myrtle speaking stella looked at him 
with round blue eyes one more guess she suggested chestnuts he guessed she nodded her 
head gaily what hair he thought thenwhere are they here's one laughed his new acquaintance 
holding out a tiny hand under her laughing encouragement he was finding his voice stingy 
he said now isn't that mean she exclaimed i gave him the only one i 
had don't you give him any of yours myrtle i take it back he pleaded 
i didn't know i won't exclaimed myrtle here stella and she held out the few 
nuts she had left take these and don't you give him any she put them 
in stella's eager hands he saw her meaning it was an invitation to a contest 
she wanted him to try to make her give him some he fell in with 
her plan here he stretched out his palm that's not right she shook her head 
one anyhow he insisted her head moved negatively from side to side slowly one he 
pleaded drawing near again the golden negative but her hand was at the side nearest 
him where he could seize it she started to pass its contents behind her to 
the other hand but he jumped and caught it myrtle quick she called myrtle came 
it was a threehanded struggle in the midst of the contest stella twisted and rose 
to her feet her hair brushed his face he held her tiny hand firmly for 
a moment he looked into her eyes what was it he could not say only 
he half let go and gave her the victory there she smiled now i'll give 
you one he took it laughing what he wanted was to take her in his 
arms a little while before supper his father came in and sat down but presently 
took a chicago paper and went into the dining room to read then his mother 
called them to the table and he sat by stella he was intensely interested in 
what she did and said if her lips moved he noted just how when her 
teeth showed he thought they were lovely a little ringlet on her forehead beckoned him 
like a golden finger he felt the wonder of the poetic phrase the shining strands 
of her hair after dinner he and myrtle and stella went back to the sitting 
room his father stayed behind to read his mother to wash dishes myrtle left the 
room after a bit to help her mother and then these two were left alone 
he hadn't much to say now that they were togetherhe couldn't talk something about her 
beauty kept him silent do you like school she asked after a time she felt 
as if they must talk only fairly well he replied i'm not much interested i 
think i'll quit one of these days and go to work what do you expect 
to do i don't know yeti'd like to be an artist he confessed his ambition 
for the first time in his lifewhy he could not have said stella took no 
note of it i was afraid they wouldn't let me enter second year high school 
but they did she remarked the superintendent at moline had to write the superintendent here 
they're mean about those things he cogitated she got up and went to the bookcase 
to look at the books he followed after a little do you like dickens she 
asked he nodded his head solemnly in approval pretty much he said i can't like 
him he's too long drawn out i like scott better i like scott he said 
i'll tell you a lovely book that i like she paused her lips parted trying 
to remember the name she lifted her hand as though to pick the title out 
of the air the fair god she exclaimed at last yesit's fine he approved i 
thought the scene in the old aztec temple where they were going to sacrifice ahwahee 
was so wonderful oh yes i liked that she added she pulled out ben hur 
and turned its leaves idly and this was so good wonderful they paused and she 
went to the window standing under the cheap lace curtains it was a moonlight night 
the rows of trees that lined the street on either side were leafless the grass 
brown and dead through the thin interlaced twigs that were like silver filigree they could 
see the lamps of other houses shining through halfdrawn blinds a man went by a 
black shadow in the halflight isn't it lovely she said eugene came near it's fine 
he answered i wish it were cold enough to skate do you skate she turned 
to him yes indeed he replied my it's so nice on a moonlit night i 
used to skate a lot at moline we skate a lot here there're two lakes 
you know he thought of the clear crystal nights when the ice of green lake 
had split every so often with a great resounding rumble he thought of the crowds 
of boys and girls shouting the distant shadows the stars up to now he had 
never found any girl to skate with successfully he had never felt just easy with 
anyone he had tried it but once he had fallen with a girl and it 
had almost cured him of skating forever he felt as though he could skate with 
stella he felt that she might like to skate with him when it gets colder 
we might go he ventured myrtle skates oh that'll be fine she applauded still she 
looked out into the street after a bit she came back to the fire and 
stood before him pensively looking down do you think your father will stay here he 
asked he says so he likes it very much do you yesnow why now oh 
i didn't like it at first why oh i guess it was because i didn't 
know anybody i like it though now she lifted her eyes he drew a little 
nearer it's a nice place he said but there isn't much for me here i 
think i'll leave next year where do you think you'll go to chicago i don't 
want to stay here she turned her body toward the fire and he moved to 
a chair behind her leaning on its back she felt him there rather close but 
did not move he was surprising himself aren't you ever coming back she asked maybe 
it all depends i suppose so i shouldn't think you'd want to leave yet why 
you say it's so nice he made no answer and she looked over her shoulder 
he was leaning very much toward her will you skate with me this winter he 
asked meaningly she nodded her head myrtle came in what are you two talking about 
she asked the fine skating we have here he said i love to skate she 
exclaimed so do i added stella it's heavenly chapter ii some of the incidents of 
this courtship that followed ephemeral as it was left a profound impression on eugene's mind 
they met to skate not long after for the snow came and the ice and 
there was wonderful skating on green lake the frost was so prolonged that men with 
horses and icesaws were cutting blocks a foot thick over at miller's point where the 
ice houses were almost every day after thanksgiving there were crowds of boys and girls 
from the schools scooting about like water skippers eugene could not always go on week 
evenings and saturdays because he had to assist his father at the store but at 
regular intervals he could ask myrtle to get stella and let them all go together 
at night and at other times he would ask her to go alone not infrequently 
she did on one particular occasion they were below a group of houses which crept 
near the lake on high ground the moon was up its wooing rays reflected in 
the polished surfaces of the ice through the black masses of trees that lined the 
shore could be seen the glow of windows yellow and homey eugene and stella had 
slowed up to turn about having left the crowd of skaters some distance back stella's 
golden curls were covered except for a few ringlets with a french cap her body 
to below the hips encased in a white wool jersey closefitting and shapely the skirt 
below was a grey mixture of thick wool and the stockings were covered by white 
woolen leggings she looked tempting and knew it suddenly as they turned one of her 
skates came loose and she hobbled and exclaimed about it wait said eugene i'll fix 
it she stood before him and he fell to his knees undoing the twisted strap 
when he had the skate off and ready for her foot he looked up and 
she looked down on him smiling he dropped the skate and flung his arms around 
her hips laying his head against her waist you're a bad boy she said for 
a few minutes she kept silent for as the center of this lovely scene she 
was divine while he held her she pulled off his wool cap and laid her 
hand on his hair it almost brought tears to his eyes he was so happy 
at the same time it awakened a tremendous passion he clutched her significantly fix my 
skate now she said wisely he got up to hug her but she would not 
let him no no she protested you mustn't do like that i won't come with 
you if you do oh stella he pleaded i mean it she insisted you mustn't 
do like that he subsided hurt half angry but he feared her will she was 
really not as ready for caresses as he had thought another time a sleighing party 
was given by some school girls and stella eugene and myrtle were invited it was 
a night of snow and stars not too cold but bracing a great boxwagon had 
been dismantled of its body and the latter put on runners and filled with straw 
and warm robes eugene and myrtle like the others had been picked up at their 
door after the sleigh had gone the rounds of some ten peaceful little homes stella 
was not in yet but in a little while her house was reached get in 
here called myrtle though she was half the length of the box away from eugene 
her request made him angry sit by me he called fearful that she would not 
she climbed in by myrtle but finding the space not to her liking moved farther 
down eugene made a special effort to have room by him and she came there 
as though by accident he drew a buffalo robe around her and thrilled to think 
that she was really there the sleigh went jingling around the town for others and 
finally struck out into the country it passed great patches of dark woods silent in 
the snow little white frame farmhouses snuggled close to the ground and with windows that 
gleamed in a vague romantic way the stars were countless and keen the whole scene 
made a tremendous impression on him for he was in love and here beside him 
in the shadow her face palely outlined was this girl he could make out the 
sweetness of her cheek her eyes the softness of her hair there was a good 
deal of chatter and singing and in the midst of these distractions he managed to 
slip an arm about her waist to get her hand in his to look close 
into her eyes trying to divine their expression she was always coy with him not 
wholly yielding three or four times he kissed her cheek furtively and once her mouth 
in a dark place he pulled her vigorously to him putting a long sensuous kiss 
on her lips that frightened her no she protested nervously you mustn't he ceased for 
a time feeling that he had pressed his advantage too closely but the night in 
all its beauty and she in hers made a lasting impression i think we ought 
to get eugene into newspaper work or something like that witla senior suggested to his 
wife it looks as though that's all he would be good for at least now 
replied mrs witla who was satisfied that her boy had not yet found himself i 
think he'll do something better later on his health isn't very good you know witla 
half suspected that his boy was naturally lazy but he wasn't sure he suggested that 
benjamin c burgess the prospective fatherinlaw of sylvia and the editor and proprietor of the 
morning appeal might give him a place as a reporter or typesetter in order that 
he might learn the business from the ground up the appeal carried few employees but 
mr burgess might have no objections to starting eugene as a reporter if he could 
write or as a student of typesetting or both he appealed to burgess one day 
on the street say burgess he said you wouldn't have a place over in your 
shop for that boy of mine would you he likes to scribble a little i 
notice i think he pretends to draw a little too though i guess it doesn't 
amount to much he ought to get into something he isn't doing anything at school 
maybe he could learn typesetting it wouldn't hurt him to begin at the bottom if 
he's going to follow that line it wouldn't matter what you paid him to begin 
with burgess thought he had seen eugene around town knew no harm of him except 
that he was lackadaisical and rather moody send him in to see me some day 
he replied noncommittally i might do something for him i'd certainly be much obliged to 
you if you would said witla he is not doing much good as it is 
now and the two men parted he went home and told eugene burgess says he 
might give you a position as a typesetter or a reporter on the appeal if 
you'd come in and see him some day he explained looking over to where his 
son was reading by the lamp does he replied eugene calmly well i can't write 
i might set type did you ask him yes said witla you'd better go to 
him some day eugene bit his lip he realized this was a commentary on his 
loafing propensities he wasn't doing very well that was certain still typesetting was no bright 
field for a person of his temperament i will he concluded when school's over better 
speak before school ends some of the other fellows might ask for it around that 
time it wouldn't hurt you to try your hand at it i will said eugene 
obediently he stopped in one sunny april afternoon at mr burgess' office it was on 
the ground floor of the threestory appeal building in the public square mr burgess a 
fat man slightly bald looked at him quizzically over his steel rimmed spectacles what little 
hair he had was gray so you think you would like to go into the 
newspaper business do you queried burgess i'd like to try my hand at it replied 
the boy i'd like to see whether i like it i can tell you right 
now there's very little in it your father says you like to write i'd like 
to well enough but i don't think i can i wouldn't mind learning typesetting if 
i ever could write i'd be perfectly willing to when do you think you'd like 
to start at the end of school if it's all the same to you it 
doesn't make much difference i'm not really in need of anybody but i could use 
you would you be satisfied with five a week yes sir well come in when 
you are ready i'll see what i can do he waved the prospective typesetter away 
with a movement of his fat hand and turned to his black walnut desk dingy 
covered with newspapers and lit by a green shaded electric light eugene went out the 
smell of fresh printing ink in his nose and the equally aggressive smell of damp 
newspapers it was going to be an interesting experience he thought but perhaps a waste 
of time he did not think so much of alexandria some time he was going 
to get out of it the office of the appeal was not different from that 
of any other country newspaper office within the confines of our two hemispheres on the 
ground floor in front was the business office and in the rear the one large 
flat bed press and the job presses on the second floor was the composing room 
with its rows of type cases on their high racksfor this newspaper was like most 
other country newspapers still set by hand and in front was the one dingy office 
of the socalled editor or managing editor or city editorfor all three were the same 
person a mr caleb williams whom burgess had picked up in times past from heaven 
knows where williams was a small lean wiry man with a black pointed beard and 
a glass eye which fixed you oddly with its black pupil he was talkative skipped 
about from duty to duty wore most of the time a green shade pulled low 
over his forehead and smoked a brown briar pipe he had a fund of knowledge 
piled up in metropolitan journalistic experience but he was anchored here with a wife and 
three children after sailing no doubt a chartless sea of troubles and was glad to 
talk life and experiences after office hours with almost anybody it took him from eight 
in the morning until two in the afternoon to gather what local news there was 
and either write it or edit it he seemed to have a number of correspondents 
who sent him weekly batches of news from surrounding points the associated press furnished him 
with a few minor items by telegraph and there was a patent insides two pages 
of fiction household hints medicine ads and what not which saved him considerable time and 
stress most of the news which came to him received short shrift in the matter 
of editing in chicago we used to give a lot of attention to this sort 
of thing williams was wont to declare to anyone who was near but you can't 
do it down here the readers really don't expect it they're looking for local items 
i always look after the local items pretty sharp mr burgess took care of the 
advertising sections in fact he solicited advertising personally saw that it was properly set up 
as the advertiser wanted it and properly placed according to the convenience of the day 
and the rights and demands of others he was the politician of the concern the 
handshaker the guider of its policy he wrote editorials now and then or with williams 
decided just what their sense must be met the visitors who came to the office 
to see the editor and arbitrated all known forms of difficulties he was at the 
beck and call of certain republican partyleaders in the county but that seemed natural for 
he was a republican himself by temperament and disposition he was appointed postmaster once to 
pay him for some useful services but he declined because he was really making more 
out of his paper than his postmastership would have brought he received whatever city or 
county advertising it was in the power of the republican leaders to give him and 
so he did very well the complications of his political relationships williams knew in part 
but they never troubled that industrious soul he dispensed with moralizing i have to make 
a living for myself my wife and three children that's enough to keep me going 
without bothering my head about other people so this office was really run very quietly 
efficiently and in most ways pleasantly it was a sunny place to work witla who 
came here at the end of his eleventh school year and when he had just 
turned seventeen was impressed with the personality of mr williams he liked him he came 
to like a jonas lyle who worked at what might be called the head desk 
of the composing room and a certain john summers who worked at odd timeswhenever there 
was an extra rush of job printing he learned very quickly that john summers who 
was fiftyfive grey and comparatively silent was troubled with weak lungs and drank summers would 
slip out of the office at various times in the day and be gone from 
five to fifteen minutes no one ever said anything for there was no pressure here 
what work was to be done was done jonas lyle was of a more interesting 
nature he was younger by ten years stronger better built but still a character he 
was semiphlegmatic philosophic feebly literary he had worked as eugene found out in the course 
of time in nearly every part of the united statesdenver portland st paul st louis 
where not and had a fund of recollections of this proprietor and that whenever he 
saw a name of particular distinction in the newspapers he was apt to bring the 
paper to williamsand later when they became familiar to eugeneand say i knew that fellow 
out in he was postmaster or what not at x he's come up considerably since 
i knew him in most cases he did not know these celebrities personally at all 
but he knew of them and the echo of their fame sounding in this outoftheway 
corner of the world impressed him he was a careful reader of proof for williams 
in a rush a quick typesetter a man who stayed by his tasks faithfully but 
he hadn't got anywhere in the world for after all he was little more than 
a machine eugene could see that at a glance it was lyle who taught him 
the art of typesetting he demonstrated the first day the theory of the squares or 
pockets in a case how some letters were placed more conveniently to the hand than 
others why some letters were well represented as to quantity why capitals were used in 
certain offices for certain purposes in others not now on the chicago tribune we used 
to italicize the names of churches boats books hotels and things of that sort that's 
the only paper i ever knew to do that he remarked what slugs sticks galleys 
turnovers meant came rapidly to the surface that the fingers would come to recognize weights 
of leads by the touch that a letter would almost instinctively find its way back 
to its proper pocket even though you were not thinking once you became expert were 
facts which he cheerfully communicated he wanted his knowledge taken seriously and this serious attention 
eugene because of his innate respect for learning of any kind was only too glad 
to give him he did not know what he wanted to do but he knew 
quite well that he wanted to see everything this shop was interesting to him for 
some little time for this reason for though he soon found that he did not 
want to be a typesetter or a reporter or indeed anything much in connection with 
a country newspaper he was learning about life he worked at his desk cheerfully smiling 
out upon the world which indicated its presence to him through an open window read 
the curious bits of news or opinion or local advertisements as he set them up 
and dreamed of what the world might have in store for him he was not 
vastly ambitious as yet but hopeful and withal a little melancholy he could see boys 
and girls whom he knew idling in the streets or on the corner squares he 
could see where ted martinwood was driving by in his father's buggy or george anderson 
was going up the street with the air of someone who would never need to 
work george's father owned the one and only hotel there were thoughts in his mind 
of fishing boating lolling somewhere with some pretty girl but alas girls did not apparently 
take to him so very readily he was too shy he thought it must be 
nice to be rich so he dreamed eugene was at that age when he wished 
to express himself in ardent phrases he was also at the age when bashfulness held 
him in reserve even though he were in love and intensely emotional he could only 
say to stella what seemed trivial things and look his intensity whereas it was the 
trivial things that were most pleasing to her not the intensity she was even then 
beginning to think he was a little strange a little too tense for her disposition 
yet she liked him it became generally understood around town that stella was his girl 
school day mating usually goes that way in a small city or village he was 
seen to go out with her his father teased him her mother and father deemed 
this a manifestation of calf love not so much on her part for they were 
aware of her tendency to hold lightly any manifestation of affection on the part of 
boys but on his they thought his sentimentalism would soon be wearisome to stella and 
they were not far wrong about her on one occasion at a party given by 
several high school girls a country post office was organized that was one of those 
games which mean kissing only a system of guessing results in a series of forfeits 
if you miss you must be postmaster and call someone for mail mail means to 
be kissed in a dark room where the postmaster stands by someone whom you like 
or who likes you you as postmaster have authority or compulsionhowever you feel about itto 
call whom you please in this particular instance stella who was caught before eugene was 
under compulsion to call someone to kiss her first thought was of him but on 
account of the frankness of the deed and because there was a lurking fear in 
her of his eagerness the name she felt impelled to speak was harvey rutter harvey 
was a handsome boy whom stella had met after her first encounter with eugene he 
was not as yet fascinating to her but pleasing she had a coquettish desire to 
see what he was like this was her first direct chance he stepped gaily in 
and eugene was at once insane with jealousy he could not understand why she should 
treat him in that way when it came to his turn he called for bertha 
shoemaker whom he admired and who was sweet in a way but who was as 
nothing to stella in his estimation the pain of kissing her when he really wanted 
the other girl was great when he came out stella saw moodiness in his eyes 
but chose to ignore it he was obviously halfhearted and downcast in his simulation of 
joy a second chance came to her and this time she called him he went 
but was in a semidefiant mood he wanted to punish her when they met in 
the dark she expected him to put his arms around her her own hands were 
up to about where his shoulders should be instead he only took hold of one 
of her arms with his hand and planted a chilly kiss on her lips if 
he had only asked why did you or held her close and pleaded with her 
not to treat him so badly the relationship might have lasted longer instead he said 
nothing and she grew defiant and she went out gaily there was a strain of 
reserve running between them until the party broke up and he took her home you 
must be melancholy tonight she remarked after they had walked two blocks in complete silence 
the streets were dark and their feet sounded hollowly on the brick pavement oh i'm 
feeling all right he replied moodily i think it's awfully nice at the weimers' we 
always have so much fun there yes lots of fun he echoed contemptuously oh don't 
be so cross she flared you haven't any reason for fussing haven't i no you 
haven't well if that's the way you feel about it i suppose i haven't i 
don't see it that way well it doesn't make any difference to me how you 
see it oh doesn't it no it doesn't her head was up and she was 
angry well i'm sure then it doesn't to me there was another silence which endured 
until they were almost home are you coming to the sociable next thursday he inquired 
he was referring to a methodist evening entertainment which although he cared very little about 
it was a convenience as it enabled him to see her and take her home 
he was prompted to ask by the fear that an open rupture was impending no 
she said i don't think i will why not i don't care to i think 
you're mean he said reprovingly i don't care she replied i think you're too bossy 
i don't think i like you very much anyhow his heart contracted ominously you can 
do as you please he persisted they reached her gate it was his wont to 
kiss her in the shadowto hold her tight for a few minutes in spite of 
her protests tonight as they approached he thought of doing it but she gave him 
no chance when they reached the gate she opened it quickly and slipped in goodnight 
she called goodnight he said and then as she reached her door stella it was 
open and she slipped in he stood in the dark hurt sore oppressed what should 
he do he strolled home cudgelling his brain whether never to speak to or look 
at her again until she came to him or to hunt her up and fight 
it all out with her she was in the wrong he knew that when he 
went to bed he was grieving over it and when he awoke it was with 
him all day he had been gaining rather rapidly as a student of typesetting and 
to a certain extent of the theory of reporting and he worked diligently and earnestly 
at his proposed trade he loved to look out of the window and draw though 
of late after knowing stella so well and coming to quarrel with her because of 
her indifference there was little heart in it this getting to the office putting on 
an apron and starting in on some local correspondence left over from the day before 
or some telegraph copy which had been freshly filed on his hook had its constructive 
value williams endeavored to use him on some local items of news as a reporter 
but he was a slow worker and almost a failure at getting all the facts 
he did not appear to know how to interview anybody and would come back with 
a story which needed to be filled in from other sources he really did not 
understand the theory of news and williams could only make it partially clear to him 
mostly he worked at his case but he did learn some things for one thing 
the theory of advertising began to dawn on him these local merchants put in the 
same ads day after day and many of them did not change them noticeably he 
saw lyle and summers taking the same ads which had appeared unchangingly from month to 
month in so far as their main features were concerned and alter only a few 
words before returning them to the forms he wondered at the sameness of them and 
when at last they were given to him to revise he often wished he could 
change them a little the language seemed so dull why don't they ever put little 
drawings in these ads he asked lyle one day don't you think they'd look a 
little better oh i don't know replied jonas they look pretty good these people around 
here wouldn't want anything like that they'd think it was too fancy eugene had seen 
and in a way studied the ads in the magazines they seemed so much more 
fascinating to him why couldn't newspaper ads be different still it was never given to 
him to trouble over this problem mr burgess dealt with the advertisers he settled how 
the ads were to be he never talked to eugene or summers about them not 
always to lyle he would sometimes have williams explain just what their character and layout 
was to be eugene was so young that williams at first did not pay very 
much attention to him but after a while he began to realize that there was 
a personality here and then he would explain thingswhy space had to be short for 
some items and long for others why county news news of small towns around alexandria 
and about people was much more important financially to the paper than the correct reporting 
of the death of the sultan of turkey the most important thing was to get 
the local names right don't ever misspell them he once cautioned him don't ever leave 
out a part of a name if you can help it people are awfully sensitive 
about that they'll stop their subscription if you don't watch out and you won't know 
what's the matter eugene took all these things to heart he wanted to see how 
the thing was done though basically it seemed to be a little small in fact 
people seemed a little small mostly one of the things that did interest him was 
to see the paper put on the press and run off he liked to help 
lock up the forms and to see how they were imposed and registered he liked 
to hear the press run and to help carry the wet papers to the mailing 
tables and the distributing counter out in front the paper hadn't a very large circulation 
but there was a slight hum of life about that time and he liked it 
he liked the sense of getting his hands and face streaked and not caring and 
of seeing his hair tousled in the mirror he tried to be useful and the 
various people on the paper came to like him though he was often a little 
awkward and slow he was not strong at this period and his stomach troubled him 
he thought too that the smell of the ink might affect his lungs though he 
did not seriously fear it in the main it was interesting but small there was 
a much larger world outside he knew that he hoped to go to it some 
day he hoped to go to chicago chapter iii eugene grew more and more moody 
and rather restless under stella's increasing independence she grew steadily more indifferent because of his 
moods the fact that other boys were crazy for her consideration was a great factor 
the fact that one particular boy harvey rutter was persistently genial not insistent really better 
looking than eugene and much better tempered helped a great deal eugene saw her with 
him now and then saw her go skating with him or at least with a 
crowd of which he was a member eugene hated him heartily he hated her at 
times for not yielding to him wholly but he was none the less wild over 
her beauty it stamped his brain with a type or ideal thereafter he knew in 
a really definite way what womanhood ought to be to be really beautiful another thing 
it did was to bring home to him a sense of his position in the 
world so far he had always been dependent on his parents for food clothes and 
spending money and his parents were not very liberal he knew other boys who had 
money to run up to chicago or down to springfieldthe latter was nearerto have a 
saturday and sunday lark no such gaieties were for him his father would not allow 
it or rather would not pay for it there were other boys who in consequence 
of amply provided spending money were the town dandies he saw them kicking their heels 
outside the corner book store the principal loafing place of the elite on wednesdays and 
saturdays and sometimes on sunday evenings preparatory to going somewhere dressed in a luxury of 
clothing which was beyond his wildest dreams ted martinwood the son of the principal drygoods 
man had a frock coat in which he sometimes appeared when he came down to 
the barber shop for a shave before he went to call on his girl george 
anderson was possessed of a dress suit and wore dancing pumps at all dances there 
was ed waterbury who was known to have a horse and runabout of his own 
these youths were slightly older and were interested in girls of a slightly older set 
but the point was the same these things hurt him he himself had no avenue 
of progress which so far as he could see was going to bring him to 
any financial prosperity his father was never going to be rich anybody could see that 
he himself had made no practical progress in schoolworkhe knew that he hated insurancesoliciting or 
writing despised the sewing machine business and did not know where he would get with 
anything which he might like to do in literature or art his drawing seemed a 
joke his writing or wish for writing pointless he was broodingly unhappy one day williams 
who had been watching him for a long time stopped at his desk i say 
witla why don't you go to chicago he said there's a lot more up there 
for a boy like you than down here you'll never get anywhere working on a 
country newspaper i know it said eugene now with me it's different went on williams 
i've had my rounds i've got a wife and three children and when a man's 
got a family he can't afford to take chances but you're young yet why don't 
you go to chicago and get on a paper you could get something what could 
i get asked eugene well you might get a job as typesetter if you'd join 
the union i don't know how good you'd be as a reporteri hardly think that's 
your line but you might study art and learn to draw newspaper artists make good 
money eugene thought of his art it wasn't much he didn't do much with it 
still he thought of chicago the world appealed to him if he could only get 
out of hereif he could only make more than seven or eight dollars a week 
he brooded about this one sunday afternoon he and stella went with myrtle to sylvia's 
home and after a brief stay stella announced that she would have to be going 
her mother would be expecting her back myrtle was for going with her but altered 
her mind when sylvia asked her to stay to tea let eugene take her home 
sylvia said eugene was delighted in his persistent hopeless way he was not yet convinced 
that she could not be won to love when they walked out in the fresh 
sweet airit was nearing springhe felt that now he should have a chance of saying 
something which would be winningwhich would lure her to him they went out on a 
street next to the one she lived on quite to the confines of the town 
she wanted to turn off at her street but he had urged her not to 
do you have to go home just yet he asked pleadingly no i can walk 
a little way she replied they reached a vacant placethe last house a little distance 
backtalking idly it was getting hard to make talk in his efforts to be entertaining 
he picked up three twigs to show her how a certain trick in balancing was 
performed it consisted in laying two at right angles with each other and with a 
third using the latter as an upright she could not do it of course she 
was not really very much interested he wanted her to try and when she did 
took hold of her right hand to steady her efforts no don't she said drawing 
her hand away i can do it she trifled with the twigs unsuccessfully and was 
about to let them fall when he took hold of both her hands it was 
so sudden that she could not free herself and so she looked him straight in 
the eye let go eugene please let go he shook his head gazing at her 
please let go she went on you mustn't do this i don't want you to 
why because because why well because i don't don't you like me any more stella 
really he asked i don't think i do not that way but you did i 
thought i did have you changed your mind yes i think i have he dropped 
her hands and looked at her fixedly and dramatically the attitude did not appeal to 
her they strolled back to the street and when they neared her door he said 
well i suppose there's no use in my coming to see you any more i 
think you'd better not she said simply she walked in never looking back and instead 
of going back to his sister's he went home he was in a very gloomy 
mood and after sitting around for a while went to his room the night fell 
and he sat there looking out at the trees and grieving about what he had 
lost perhaps he was not good enough for herhe could not make her love him 
was it that he was not handsome enoughhe did not really consider himself good lookingor 
what was it a lack of courage or strength after a time he noticed that 
the moon was hanging over the trees like a bright shield in the sky two 
layers of thin clouds were moving in different directions on different levels he stopped in 
his cogitations to think where these clouds came from on sunny days when there were 
great argosies of them he had seen them disappear before his eyes and then marvel 
of marvels reappear out of nothingness the first time he ever saw this it astonished 
him greatly for he had never known up to then what clouds were afterward he 
read about them in his physical geography tonight he thought of that and of the 
great plains over which these winds swept and of the grass and treesgreat forests of 
themmiles and miles what a wonderful world poets wrote about these things longfellow and bryant 
and tennyson he thought of thanatopsis and of the elegy both of which he admired 
greatly what was this thing life then he came back to stella with an ache 
she was actually gone and she was so beautiful she would never really talk to 
him any more he would never get to hold her hand or kiss her he 
clenched his hands with the hurt oh that night on the ice that night in 
the sleigh how wonderful they were finally he undressed and went to bed he wanted 
to be aloneto be lonely on his clean white pillow he lay and dreamed of 
the things that might have been kisses caresses a thousand joys one sunday afternoon he 
was lying in his hammock thinking thinking of what a dreary place alexandria was anyhow 
when he opened a chicago saturday afternoon paper which was something like a sunday one 
because it had no sunday editionand went gloomily through it it was as he had 
always found full of a subtle wonder the wonder of the city which drew him 
like a magnet here was the drawing of a big hotel someone was going to 
build there was a sketch of a great pianist who was coming to play an 
account of a new comedy drama of a little romantic section of goose island in 
the chicago river with its old decayed boats turned into houses and geese waddling about 
an item of a man falling through a coal hole on south halstead street fascinated 
him this last was at sixtytwo hundred and something and the idea of such a 
long street seized on his imagination what a tremendous city chicago must be the thought 
of car lines crowds trains came to him with almost a yearning appeal all at 
once the magnet got him it gripped his very soul this wonder this beauty this 
life i'm going to chicago he thought and got up there was his nice quiet 
little home laid out before him inside were his mother his father myrtle still he 
was going he could come back sure i can come back he thought propelled by 
this magnetic power he went in and upstairs to his room and got a little 
grip or portmanteau he had he put in it the things he thought he would 
immediately need in his pocket were nine dollars money he had been saving for some 
time finally he came downstairs and stood in the door of the sitting room what's 
the matter asked his mother looking at his solemn introspective face i'm going to chicago 
he said when she asked astonished a little uncertain of just what he meant today 
he said no you're joking she smiled unbelievingly this was a boyish prank i'm going 
today he said i'm going to catch that four o'clock train her face saddened you're 
not she said i can come back he replied if i want to i want 
to get something else to do his father came in at this time he had 
a little work room out in the barn where he sometimes cleaned machines and repaired 
vehicles he was fresh from such a task now what's up he asked seeing his 
wife close to her boy eugene's going to chicago since when he inquired amusedly today 
he says he's going right now you don't mean it said witla astonished he really 
did not believe it why don't you take a little time and think it over 
what are you going to live on i'll live said eugene i'm going i've had 
enough of this place i'm going to get out all right said his father who 
after all believed in initiative evidently after all he hadn't quite understood this boy got 
your trunk packed no but mother can send me that don't go today pleaded his 
mother wait until you get something ready eugene wait and do a little thinking about 
it wait until tomorrow i want to go today ma he slipped his arm around 
her little ma he was bigger than she by now and still growing all right 
eugene she said softly but i wish you wouldn't her boy was leaving herher heart 
was hurt i can come back ma it's only a hundred miles well all right 
she said finally trying to brighten i'll pack your bag i have already she went 
to look well it'll soon be time said witla who was thinking that eugene might 
back down i'm sorry still it may be a good thing for you you're always 
welcome here you know i know said eugene they went finally to the train together 
he and his father and myrtle his mother couldn't she stayed to cry on the 
way to the depot they stopped at sylvia's why eugene she exclaimed how ridiculous don't 
go he's set said witla eugene finally got loose he seemed to be fighting love 
home ties everything every step of the way finally he reached the depot the train 
came witla grabbed his hand affectionately be a good boy he said swallowing a gulp 
myrtle kissed him you're so funny eugene write me i will he stepped on the 
train the bell rang out the cars rolledout and on he looked out on the 
familiar scenes and then a real ache came to himstella his mother his father myrtle 
the little home they were all going out of his life hm he half groaned 
clearing his throat gee and then he sank back and tried as usual not to 
think he must succeed that's what the world was made for that was what he 
was made for that was what he would have to do chapter iv the city 
of chicagowho shall portray it this vast ruck of life that had sprung suddenly into 
existence upon the dank marshes of a lake shore miles and miles of dreary little 
houses miles and miles of wooden blockpaved streets with gas lamps placed and water mains 
laid and empty wooden walks set for pedestrians the beat of a hundred thousand hammers 
the ring of a hundred thousand trowels long converging lines of telegraph poles thousands upon 
thousands of sentinel cottages factory plants towering smoke stacks and here and there a lone 
shabby church steeple sitting out pathetically upon vacant land the raw prairie stretch was covered 
with yellow grass the great broad highways of the tracks of railroads ten fifteen twenty 
thirty laid side by side and strung with thousands upon thousands of shabby cars like 
beads upon a string engines clanging trains moving people waiting at street crossingspedestrians wagon drivers 
street car drivers drays of beer trucks of coal brick stone sanda spectacle of new 
raw necessary life as eugene began to draw near it he caught for the first 
time the sense and significance of a great city what were these newspaper shadows he 
had been dealing with in his reading compared to this vivid articulate eager thing here 
was the substance of a new world substantial fascinating different the handsome suburban station at 
south chicago the first of its kind he had ever seen took his eye as 
the train rolled cityward he had never before seen a crowd of foreignersworking menand here 
were lithuanians poles czechs waiting for a local train he had never seen a really 
large factory plant and here was one and another and anothersteel works potteries soapfactories foundries 
all gaunt and hard in the sunday evening air there seemed to be for all 
it was sunday something youthful energetic and alive about the streets he noted the streetcars 
waiting at one place a small river was crossed on a drawdirty gloomy but crowded 
with boats and lined with great warehouses grain elevators coal pocketsthat architecture of necessity and 
utility his imagination was fired by this for here was something that could be done 
brilliantly in blacka spot of red or green for ship and bridge lights there were 
some men on the magazines who did things like this only not so vivid the 
train threaded its way through long lines of cars coming finally into an immense train 
shed where arc lights were splutteringa score under a great curved steel and glass roof 
where people were hurrying to and fro engines were hissing bells clanging raucously he had 
no relatives no soul to turn to but somehow he did not feel lonely this 
picture of life this newness fascinated him he stepped down and started leisurely to the 
gate wondering which way he should go he came to a corner where a lamp 
post already lit blazoned the name madison he looked out on this street and saw 
as far as the eye could reach two lines of stores jingling horse cars people 
walking what a sight he thought and turned west for three miles he walked musing 
and then as it was dark and he had arranged for no bed he wondered 
where he should eat and sleep a fat man sitting outside a livery stable door 
in a tilted caneseated chair offered a possibility of information do you know where i 
can get a room around here asked eugene the lounger looked him over he was 
the proprietor of the place there's an old lady living over there at seventhirtytwo he 
said who has a room i think she might take you in he liked eugene's 
looks eugene crossed over and rang a downstairs bell the door was opened shortly by 
a tall kindly woman of a rather matriarchal turn her hair was gray yes she 
inquired the gentleman at the livery stable over there said i might get a room 
here i'm looking for one she smiled pleasantly this boy looked his strangeness his wideeyed 
interest his freshness from the country come in she said i have a room you 
can look at it it was a front rooma little bedroom off the one main 
living room clean simple convenient this looks all right he said she smiled you can 
have it for two dollars a week she proffered that's all right he said putting 
down his grip i'll take it have you had supper she asked no but i'm 
going out soon i want to see the streets i'll find some place i'll give 
you something she said eugene thanked her and she smiled this was what chicago did 
to the country it took the boys he opened the closed shutters of his window 
and knelt before it leaning on the sill he looked out idly for it was 
all so wonderful bright lights were burning in store windows these people hurryinghow their feet 
soundedclap clap clap and away east and away west it was all like this it 
was all like this everywhere a great big wonderful city it was nice to be 
here he felt that now it was all worth while how could he have stayed 
in alexandria so long he would get along here certainly he would he was perfectly 
sure of that he knew chicago at this time certainly offered a world of hope 
and opportunity to the beginner it was so new so raw everything was in the 
making the long lines of houses and stores were mostly temporary makeshiftsone and two story 
frame affairswith here and there a three and four story brick building which spoke of 
better days to come down in the business heart which lay between the lake and 
the river the north side and the south side was a region which spoke of 
a tremendous future for here were stores which served the buying public not only of 
chicago but of the middle west there were great banks great office buildings great retail 
stores great hotels the section was running with a tide of people which represented the 
youth the illusions the untrained aspirations of millions of souls when you walked into this 
area you could feel what chicago meanteagerness hope desire it was a city that put 
vitality into almost every wavering heart: it made the beginner dream dreams the aged to 
feel that misfortune was never so grim that it might not change underneath of course 
was struggle youth and hope and energy were setting a terrific pace you had to 
work here to move to step lively you had to have ideas this city demanded 
of you your very best or it would have little to do with you youth 
in its search for somethingand agewere quickly to feel this it was no fool's paradise 
eugene once he was settled realized this he had the notion somehow that the printer's 
trade was all over for him he wanted no more of that he wanted to 
be an artist or something like that although he hardly knew how to begin the 
papers offered one way but he was not sure that they took on beginners he 
had had no training whatever his sister myrtle had once said that some of his 
little thumbnail sketches were pretty but what did she know if he could study somewhere 
find someone who would teach him meanwhile he would have to work he tried the 
newspapers first of course for those great institutions seemed the ideal resort for anyone who 
wanted to get up in the world but the teeming offices with frowning art directors 
and critical newspaper workers frightened him one art director did see something in the three 
or four little sketches he showed but he happened to be in a crusty mood 
and did not want anybody anyway he simply said no there was nothing eugene thought 
that perhaps as an artist also he was destined to be a failure the trouble 
with this boy was really that he was not half awake yet the beauty of 
life its wonder had cast a spell over him but he could not yet interpret 
it in line and color he walked about these wonderful streets gazing in the windows 
looking at the boats on the river looking at the ships on the lake one 
day while he was standing on the lake shore there came a ship in full 
sail in the offingthe first he had ever seen it gripped his sense of beauty 
he clasped his hands nervously and thrilled to it then he sat down on the 
lake wall and looked and looked and looked until it gradually sank below the horizon 
so this was how the great lakes were and how the great seas must bethe 
atlantic and the pacific and the indian ocean ah the sea some day perhaps he 
would go to new york that was where the sea was but here it was 
also in miniature and it was wonderful one cannot moon by lake shores and before 
store windows and at bridge draws and live unless one is provided with the means 
of living and this eugene was not he had determined when he left home that 
he would be independent he wanted to get a salary in some way that he 
could at least live on he wanted to write back and be able to say 
that he was getting along nicely his trunk came and a loving letter from his 
mother and some money but he sent that back it was only ten dollars but 
he objected to beginning that way he thought he ought to earn his own way 
and he wanted to try anyhow after ten days his funds were very low a 
dollar and seventyfive cents and he decided that any job would have to do never 
mind about art or typesetting now he could not get the last without a union 
card he must take anything and so he applied from store to store the cheap 
little shops in which he asked were so ugly they hurt but he tried to 
put his artistic sensibilities aside he asked for anything to be made a clerk in 
a bakery in a dry goods store in a candy store after a time a 
hardware store loomed up and he asked there the man looked at him curiously i 
might give you a place at storing stoves eugene did not understand but he accepted 
gladly it only paid six dollars a week but he could live on that he 
was shown to a loft in charge of two rough men stove fitters polishers and 
repairers who gruffly explained to him that his work was to brush the rust off 
the decayed stoves to help piece and screw them together to polish and lift things 
for this was a second hand stove business which bought and repaired stoves from junk 
dealers all over the city eugene had a low bench near a window where he 
was supposed to do his polishing but he very frequently wasted his time here looking 
out into the green yards of some houses in a side street the city was 
full of wonder to himits every detail fascinating when a ragpicker would go by calling 
rags old iron or a vegetable vender crying tomatoes potatoes green corn peas he would 
stop and listen the musical pathos of the cries appealing to him alexandria had never 
had anything like this it was all so strange he saw himself making pen and 
ink sketches of things of the clothes lines in the back yards and of the 
maids with baskets on one of the days when he thought he was working fairly 
well he had been there two weeks one of the two repairers said hey get 
a move on you you're not paid to look out the window eugene stopped he 
had not realized that he was loafing what have you got to do with it 
he asked hurt and half defiant he was under the impression that he was working 
with these men not under them i'll show you you fresh kid said the older 
of the two who was an individual built on the order of bill sykes you're 
under me you get a move on you and don't give me any more of 
your lip eugene was startled it was a flash of brutality out of a clear 
sky the animal whom he had been scanning as an artist would as a type 
out of the corner of his eye was revealing himself you go to the devil 
said eugene only half awake to the grim reality of the situation what's that exclaimed 
the man making for him he gave him a shove toward the wall and attempted 
to kick him with his big hobnailed boot eugene picked up a stove leg his 
face was wax white don't you try that again he said darkly he fixed the 
leg in his hand firmly call it off jim said the other man who saw 
the uselessness of so much temper don't hit him send him down stairs if you 
don't like him you get to hell out of here then said eugene's noble superior 
eugene walked to a nail where his hat and coat were carrying the stove leg 
he edged past his assailant cautiously fearing a second attack the man was inclined to 
kick at him again because of his stubbornness but forebore you're too fresh willie you 
want to wake up you dough face he said as eugene went eugene slipped out 
quietly his spirit was hurt and torn what a scene he eugene witla kicked at 
and almost kicked out and that in a job that paid six dollars a week 
a great lump came up in his throat but it went down again he wanted 
to cry but he could not he went downstairs stovepolish on his hands and face 
and slipped up to the desk i want to quit he said to the man 
who had hired him all right what's the matter that big brute up there tried 
to kick me he explained they're pretty rough men answered the employer i was afraid 
you wouldn't get along i guess you're not strong enough here you are he laid 
out three dollars and a half eugene wondered at this queer interpretation of his complaint 
he must get along with these men they musn't get along with him so the 
city had that sort of brutality in it he went home and washed up and 
then struck out again for it was no time now to be without a job 
after a week he found oneas a house runner for a real estate concern a 
young man to bring in the numbers of empty houses and post up the for 
rent signs in the windows it paid eight dollars and seemed to offer opportunities of 
advancement eugene might have stayed there indefinitely had it not failed after three months he 
had reached the season of fall clothes then and the need of a winter overcoat 
but he made no complaint to his family he wanted to appear to be getting 
along well whether he was or not one of the things which tended to harden 
and sharpen his impressions of life at this time was the show of luxury seen 
in some directions on michigan avenue and prairie avenue on ashland avenue and washington boulevard 
were sections which were crowded with splendid houses such as eugene had never seen before 
he was astonished at the magnificence of their appointments the beauty of the lawns the 
show of the windows the distinction of the equipages which accompanied them and served them 
for the first time in his life he saw liveried footmen at doors: he saw 
at a distance girls and women grown who seemed marvels of beauty to himthey were 
so distinguished in their dress he saw young men carrying themselves with an air of 
distinction which he had never seen before these must be the society people the newspapers 
were always talking about his mind made no distinctions as yet if there were fine 
clothes fine trappings of course social prestige went with them it made him see for 
the first time what far reaches lay between the conditions of a beginner from the 
country and what the world really had to offeror rather what it showered on some 
at the top it subdued and saddened him a little life was unfair these fall 
days too with their brown leaves sharp winds scudding smoke and whirls of dust showed 
him that the city could be cruel he met shabby men sunken eyed gloomy haggard 
who looked at him apparently out of a deep despair these creatures all seemed to 
be brought where they were by difficult circumstances if they begged at alland they rarely 
did of him for he did not look prosperous enough it was with the statement 
that unfortunate circumstances had brought them where they were you could fail so easily you 
could really starve if you didn't look sharpthe city quickly taught him that during these 
days he got immensely lonely he was not very sociable and too introspective he had 
no means of making friends or thought he had none so he wandered about the 
streets at night marveling at the sights he saw or staying at home in his 
little room mrs woodruff the landlady was nice and motherly enough but she was not 
young and did not fit into his fancies he was thinking about girls and how 
sad it was not to have one to say a word to him stella was 
gonethat dream was over when would he find another like her after wandering around for 
nearly a month during which time he was compelled to use some money his mother 
sent him to buy a suit of clothes on an instalment plan he got a 
place as driver of a laundry which because it paid ten dollars a week seemed 
very good he sketched now and then when he was not tired but what he 
did seemed pointless so he worked here driving a wagon when he should have been 
applying for an art opening or taking art lessons during this winter myrtle wrote him 
that stella appleton had moved to kansas whither her father had gone and that his 
mother's health was bad and that she did so want him to come home and 
stay awhile it was about this time that he became acquainted with a little scotch 
girl named margaret duff who worked in the laundry and became quickly involved in a 
relationship which established a precedent in his experiences with women before this he had never 
physically known a girl now and of a sudden he was plunged into something which 
awakened a new and if not evil at least disrupting and disorganizing propensity of his 
character he loved women the beauty of the curves of their bodies he loved beauty 
of feature and after a while was to love beauty of mindhe did now in 
a vague unformed waybut his ideal was as yet not clear to him margaret duff 
represented some simplicity of attitude some generosity of spirit some shapeliness of form some comeliness 
of featureit was not more but growing by what it fed on his sex appetite 
became powerful in a few weeks it had almost mastered him he burned to be 
with this girl dailyand she was perfectly willing that he should so long as the 
relationship did not become too conspicuous she was a little afraid of her parents although 
those two being working people retired early and slept soundly they did not seem to 
mind her early philanderings with boys this latest one was no novelty it burned fiercely 
for three monthseugene was eager insatiable: the girl not so much so but complaisant she 
liked this evidence of fire in himthe hard burning flame she had aroused and yet 
after a time she got a little tired then little personal differences arosedifferences of taste 
differences of judgment differences of interest he really could not talk to her of anything 
serious could not get a response to his more delicate emotions for her part she 
could not find in him any ready appreciation of the little things she likedtheater jests 
and the bright remarks of other boys and girls she had some conception of what 
was tasteful in dress but as for anything else art literature public affairs she knew 
nothing at all while eugene for all his youth was intensely alive to what was 
going on in the great world the sound of great names and great fames was 
in his earscarlyle emerson thoreau whitman he read of great philosophers painters musicians meteors that 
sped across the intellectual sky of the western world and he wondered he felt as 
though some day he would be called to do somethingin his youthful enthusiasm he halfthought 
it might be soon he knew that this girl he was trifling with could not 
hold him she had lured him but once lured he was master judge critic he 
was beginning to feel that he could get along without herthat he could find someone 
better naturally such an attitude would make for the death of passion as the satiation 
of passion would make for the development of such an attitude margaret became indifferent she 
resented his superior airs his toplofty tone at times they quarreled over little things one 
night he suggested something that she ought to do in the haughty manner customary with 
him oh don't be so smart she said you always talk as though you owned 
me i do he said jestingly do you she flared there are others well whenever 
you're ready you can have them i'm willing the tone cut her though actually it 
was only an illtimed bit of teasing more kindly meant than it sounded well i'm 
ready now you needn't come to see me unless you want to i can get 
along she tossed her head don't be foolish margy he said seeing the ill wind 
he had aroused you don't mean that don't i well we'll see she walked away 
from him to another corner of the room he followed her but her anger rearoused 
his opposition oh all right he said after a time i guess i'd better be 
going she made no response neither pleas nor suggestions he went and secured his hat 
and coat and came back want to kiss me goodbye he inquired no she said 
simply goodnight he called goodnight she replied indifferently the relationship was never amicably readjusted after 
this although it did endure for some time chapter v for the time being this 
encounter stirred to an almost unbridled degree eugene's interest in women most men are secretly 
proud of their triumph with womantheir ability to triumphand any evidence of their ability to 
attract entertain hold is one of those things which tends to give them an air 
of superiority and selfsufficiency which is sometimes lacking in those who are not so victorious 
this was in its way his first victory of the sort and it pleased him 
mightily he felt much more sure of himself instead of in any way ashamed what 
he thought did the silly boys back in alexandria know of life compared to this 
nothing he was in chicago now the world was different he was finding himself to 
be a man free individual of interest to other personalities margaret duff had told him 
many pretty things about himself she had complimented his looks his total appearance his taste 
in the selection of particular things he had felt what it is to own a 
woman he strutted about for a time the fact that he had been dismissed rather 
arbitrarily having little weight with him because he was so very ready to be dismissed 
sudden dissatisfaction with his job now stirred up in him for ten dollars a week 
was no sum wherewith any selfrespecting youth could maintain himselfparticularly with a view to sustaining 
any such relationship as that which had just ended he felt that he ought to 
get a better place then one day a woman to whom he was delivering a 
parcel at her home in warren avenue stopped him long enough to ask: what do 
you drivers get a week for your work i get ten dollars said eugene i 
think some get more you ought to make a good collector she went on she 
was a large homely incisive straighttalking woman would you like to change to that kind 
of work eugene was sick of the laundry business the hours were killing he had 
worked as late as one o'clock sunday morning i think i would he exclaimed i 
don't know anything about it but this work is no fun my husband is the 
manager of the people's furniture company she went on he needs a good collector now 
and then i think he's going to make a change very soon i'll speak to 
him eugene smiled joyously and thanked her this was surely a windfall he was anxious 
to know what collectors were paid but he thought it scarcely tactful to ask if 
he gives you a job you will probably get fourteen dollars to begin with she 
volunteered eugene thrilled that would be really a rise in the world four dollars more 
he could get some nice clothes out of that and have spending money besides he 
might get a chance to study art his visions began to multiply one could get 
up in the world by trying the energetic delivery he had done for this laundry 
had brought him this further effort in the other field might bring him more and 
he was young yet he had been working for the laundry company for six months 
six weeks later mr henry mitchly manager of the people's furniture wrote him care of 
the laundry company to call at his home any evening after eight and he would 
see him my wife has spoken to me of you he added eugene complied the 
same day that he received the note and was looked over by a lean brisk 
unctuous looking man of forty who asked him various questions as to his work his 
home how much money he took in as a driver and what not finally he 
said i need a bright young man down at my place it's a good job 
for one who is steady and honest and hardworking my wife seems to think you 
work pretty well so i'm willing to give you a trial i can put you 
to work at fourteen dollars i want you to come to see me a week 
from monday eugene thanked him he decided on mr mitchly's advice to give his laundry 
manager a full week's notice he told margaret that he was leaving and she was 
apparently glad for his sake the management was slightly sorry for eugene was a good 
driver during his last week he helped break in a new man in his place 
and on monday appeared before mr mitchly mr mitchly was glad to have him for 
he had seen him as a young man of energy and force he explained the 
simple nature of the work which was to take bills for clocks silverware rugs anything 
which the company sold and go over the various routes collecting the money duewhich would 
average from seventy five to a hundred and twentyfive dollars a day most companies in 
our line require a bond he explained but we haven't come to that yet i 
think i know honest young men when i see them anyhow we have a system 
of inspection if a man's inclined to be dishonest he can't get very far with 
us eugene had never thought of this question of honesty very much he had been 
raised where he did not need to worry about the matter of a little pocket 
change and he had made enough at the appeal to supply his immediate wants besides 
among the people he had always associated with it was considered a very right and 
necessary thing to be honest men were arrested for not being he remembered one very 
sad case of a boy he knew being arrested at alexandria for breaking into a 
store at night that seemed a terrible thing to him at the time since then 
he had been speculating a great deal in a vague way as to what honesty 
was but he had not yet decided he knew that it was expected of him 
to account for the last penny of anything that was placed in his keeping and 
he was perfectly willing to do so the money he earned seemed enough if he 
had to live on it there was no need for him to aid in supporting 
anyone else so he slipped along rather easily and practically untested eugene took the first 
day's package of bills as laid out for him and carefully went from door to 
door in some places money was paid him for which he gave a receipt in 
others he was put off or refused because of previous difficulties with the company in 
a number of places people had moved leaving no trace of themselves and packing the 
unpaid for goods with them it was his business as mr mitchly explained to try 
to get track of them from the neighbors eugene saw at once that he was 
going to like the work the fresh air the outdoor life the walking the quickness 
with which his task was accomplished all pleased him his routes took him into strange 
and new parts of the city where he had never been before and introduced him 
to types he had never met his laundry work taking him from door to door 
had been a freshening influence and this was another he saw scenes that he felt 
sure he could when he had learned to draw a little better make great things 
ofdark towering factorysites great stretches of railroad yards laid out like a puzzle in rain 
snow or bright sunlight great smokestacks throwing their black heights athwart morning or evening skies 
he liked them best in the late afternoon when they stood out in a glow 
of red or fading purple wonderful he used to exclaim to himself and think how 
the world would marvel if he could ever come to do great pictures like those 
of doré he admired the man's tremendous imagination he never thought of himself as doing 
anything in oils or water colors or chalkonly pen and ink and that in great 
rude splotches of black and white that was the way that was the way force 
was had but he could not do them he could only think them one of 
his chief joys was the chicago river its black mucky water churned by puffing tugs 
and its banks lined by great red grain elevators and black coal chutes and yellow 
lumber yards here was real color and lifethe thing to draw and then there were 
the low drab rainsoaked cottages standing in lonely shabby little rows out on flat prairie 
land perhaps a scrubby tree somewhere near he loved these he would take an envelope 
and try to get the sense of themthe feel as he called itbut it wouldn't 
come all he did seemed cheap and commonplace mere pointless lines and stiff wooden masses 
how did the great artists get their smoothness and ease he wondered chapter vi eugene 
collected and reported faithfully every day and had managed to save a little money margaret 
was now a part of his past his landlady mrs woodruff had gone to live 
with a daughter in sedalia missouri and he had moved to a comparatively nice house 
in east twentyfirst street on the south side it had taken his eye because of 
a tree in a fifty foot space of ground before it like his other room 
it cost him little and he was in a private family he arranged a twenty 
cent rate per meal for such meals as he took there and thus he managed 
to keep his bare living expenses down to five dollars a week the remaining nine 
he spent sparingly for clothes carfare and amusementsalmost nothing of the latter when he saw 
he had a little money in reserve he began to think of looking up the 
art institute which had been looming up in his mind as an avenue of advancement 
and find out on what condition he could join a night class in drawing they 
were very reasonable he heard only fifteen dollars a quarter and he decided to begin 
if the conditions were not too severe he was beginning to be convinced that he 
was born to be an artisthow soon he could not tell the old art institute 
which preceded the present impressive structure was located at michigan avenue and monroe street and 
presented an atmosphere of distinction which was not present in most of the structures representing 
the public taste of the period it was a large six storey building of brown 
stone and contained a number of studios for painters sculptors and music teachers besides the 
exhibition rooms and the rooms for the classes there were both day and evening classes 
and even at that time a large number of students the western soul to a 
certain extent was fired by the wonder of art there was so little of it 
in the life of the peoplethe fame of those who could accomplish things in this 
field and live in a more refined atmosphere was great to go to paris to 
be a student in any one of the great ateliers of that city or of 
munich or rome to know the character of the artistic treasures of europethe life of 
the art quarterthat was something there was what might have been termed a wild desire 
in the breast of many an untutored boy and girl to get out of the 
ranks of the commonplace to assume the character and the habiliments of the artistic temperament 
as they were then supposed to be to have a refined semilanguorous semiindifferent manner to 
live in a studio to have a certain freedom in morals and temperament not accorded 
to the ordinary personthese were the great things to do and be of course art 
composition was a part of this you were supposed ultimately to paint great pictures or 
do noble sculptures but in the meanwhile you could and should live the life of 
the artist and that was beautiful and wonderful and free eugene had long had some 
sense of this he was aware that there were studios in chicago that certain men 
were supposed to be doing good workhe saw it in the papers there were mentions 
now and then of exhibitions mostly free which the public attended but sparingly once there 
was an exhibition of some of the war pictures of verestchagin a great russian painter 
who had come west for some purpose eugene saw them one sunday afternoon and was 
enthralled by the magnificence of their grasp of the elements of battle the wonder of 
color the truth of character the dramatic quality the sense of force and danger and 
horror and suffering which was somehow around and in and through everything that was shown 
this man had virility and insight stupendous imagination and temperament eugene stood and stared wondering 
how such things could be done ever afterward the name of verestchagin was like a 
great call to his imagination that was the kind of an artist to be if 
you were going to be one another picture came there once which appealed to another 
side of his nature although primarily the basis of its appeal was artistic it was 
a great warm tinted nude by bouguereau a french artist who was startling his day 
with his daring portrayal of the nude the types he depicted were not nambypamby little 
slimbodied women with spindling qualities of strength and passion but great fullblown women whose voluptuous 
contour of neck and arms and torso and hip and thigh was enough to set 
the blood of youth at fever heat the man obviously understood and had passion love 
of form love of desire love of beauty he painted with a sense of the 
bridal bed in the background of motherhood and of fat growing babies joyously nursed these 
women stood up big in their sense of beauty and magnetism the soft lure of 
desire in their eyes their full lips parted their cheeks flushed with the blood of 
health as such they were anathema to the conservative and puritanical in mind the religious 
in temperament the cautious in training or taste the very bringing of this picture to 
chicago as a product for sale was enough to create a furore of objection such 
pictures should not be painted was the cry of the press or if painted not 
exhibited bouguereau was conceived of by many as one of those dastards of art who 
were endeavoring to corrupt by their talent the morals of the world there was a 
cry raised that the thing should be suppressed and as is always the case in 
all such outbursts of special class opposition the interest of the general public was aroused 
eugene was one of those who noted the discussion he had never seen a picture 
by bouguereau or indeed an original nude by any other artist being usually at liberty 
after three o'clock he was free to visit some of these things and having found 
it possible to do his work in good clothes he had come to wear his 
best suit every day he was a fairly presentable youth with a solemn mien and 
his request to be shown anything in any art store would have aroused no surprise 
he looked as though he belonged to the intellectual and artistic classes not being sure 
of what reception would be accorded one so younghe was now nearing twentyhe nevertheless ventured 
to stop at the gallery where the bouguereau was being exhibited and ask to see 
it the attendant in charge eyed him curiously but led him back to a room 
hung in dark red and turning on a burst of incandescent bulbs set in the 
ceiling of a red plush hung cabinet pulled back the curtain revealing the picture eugene 
had never seen such a figure and face it was a dream of beautyhis ideal 
come to life he studied the face and neck the soft mass of brown sensuous 
hair massed at the back of the head the flowerlike lips and soft cheeks he 
marveled at the suggestion of the breasts and the abdomen that potentiality of motherhood that 
is so firing to the male he could have stood there hours dreaming luxuriating but 
the attendant who had left him alone with it for a few minutes returned what 
is the price of this eugene asked ten thousand dollars was the reply he smiled 
solemnly it's a wonderful thing he said and turned to go the attendant put out 
the light this picture like those of verestchagin made a sharp impression on him curiously 
he had no longing to paint anything of this kind he only rejoiced to look 
at it it spoke to him of his present ideal of womanhoodphysical beauty and he 
longed with all his heart to find a creature like that who would look on 
him with favor there were other exhibitionsone containing a genuine rembrandtwhich impressed him but none 
like these that had definitely stirred him his interest in art was becoming eager he 
wanted to find out all about itto do something himself one day he ventured to 
call at the art institute building and consult the secretary who explained to him what 
the charges were he learned from her for she was a woman of a practical 
clerical turn that the classes ran from october to may that he could enter a 
life or antique class or both though the antique alone was advisable for the time 
and a class in illustration where costumes of different periods were presented on different models 
he found that each class had an instructor of supposed note whom it was not 
necessary for him to see each class had a monitor and each student was supposed 
to work faithfully for his own benefit eugene did not get to see the class 
rooms but he gained a sense of the art of it all nevertheless for the 
halls and offices were decorated in an artistic way and there were many plaster casts 
of arms legs busts and thighs and heads it was as though one stood in 
an open doorway and looked out upon a new world the one thing that gratified 
him was that he could study pen and ink or brush in the illustration class 
and that he could also join a sketch class from five to six every afternoon 
without extra charges if he preferred to devote his evening hours to studying drawing in 
the life class he was a little astonished to learn from a printed prospectus given 
him that the life class meant nude models to work fromboth men and women he 
was surely approaching a different world now it seemed necessary and natural enough and yet 
there was an aloof atmosphere about it something that suggested the inner precincts of a 
shrine to which only talent was admitted was he talented wait he would show the 
world even if he was a raw country boy the classes which he decided to 
enter were first a life class which convened monday wednesday and friday evenings at seven 
in one of the study rooms and remained in session until ten o'clock and second 
a sketch class which met from five to six every afternoon eugene felt that he 
knew little or nothing about figure and anatomy and had better work at that costume 
and illustration would have to wait and as for the landscapes or rather cityscapes of 
which he was so fond he could afford to defer those until he learned something 
of the fundamentals of art heretofore he had rarely attempted the drawing of a face 
or figure except in miniature and as details of a larger scene now he was 
confronted with the necessity of sketching in charcoal the head or body of a living 
person and it frightened him a little he knew that he would be in a 
class with fifteen or twenty other male students they would be able to see and 
comment on what he was doing twice a week an instructor would come around and 
pass upon his work there were honors for those who did the best work during 
any one month he learned from the prospectus namely: first choice of seats around the 
model at the beginning of each new pose the class instructors must be of considerable 
significance in the american art world he thought for they were n a's and that 
meant national academicians he little knew with what contempt this honor was received in some 
quarters or he would not have attached so much significance to it one monday evening 
in october armed with the several sheets of paper which he had been told to 
purchase by his allinforming prospectus he began his work he was a little nervous at 
sight of the brightly lighted halls and class rooms and the moving crowd of young 
men and women did not tend to allay his fears he was struck at once 
with the quality of gaiety determination and easy grace which marked the different members of 
this company the boys struck him as interesting virile in many cases good looking the 
girls as graceful rather dashing and confident one or two whom he noted were beautiful 
in a dark way this was a wonderful world the rooms too were exceptional they 
were old enough in use to be almost completely covered as to the walls with 
the accumulation of paint scraped from the palettes there were no easels or other paraphernalia 
but simply chairs and little stoolsthe former as eugene learned to be turned upside down 
for easels the latter for the students to sit on in the center of the 
room was a platform the height of an ordinary table for the model to pose 
on and in one corner a screen which constituted a dressing room there were no 
pictures or statuaryjust the bare wallsbut curiously in one corner a piano out in the 
halls and in the general lounging center were pictures of nude figures or parts of 
figures posed in all sorts of ways which eugene in his raw youthful way thought 
suggestive he secretly rejoiced to look at them but he felt that he must not 
say anything about what he thought an art student he felt sure must appear to 
be indifferent to such suggestionto be above such desire they were here to work not 
to dream of women when the time came for the classes to assemble there was 
a scurrying to and fro conferring between different students and then the men found themselves 
in one set of rooms and the women in another eugene saw a young girl 
in his room sitting up near the screen idly gazing about she was pretty of 
a slightly irish cast of countenance with black hair and black eyes she wore a 
cap that was an imitation of the polish national headdress and a red cape eugene 
assumed her to be the class model and secretly wondered if he was really to 
see her in the nude in a few minutes all the students were gathered and 
then there was a stir as there strolled in a rather vigorous and picturesque man 
of thirtysix or thereabouts who sauntered to the front of the room and called the 
class to order he was clad in a shabby suit of grey tweed and crowned 
with a little brown hat shoved rakishly over one ear which he did not trouble 
to take off he wore a soft blue hickory shirt without collar or tie and 
looked immensely selfsufficient he was tall and lean and rawboned with a face which was 
long and narrow his eyes were large and wide set his mouth big and firm 
in its lines he had big hands and feet and an almost rolling gait eugene 
assumed instinctively that this was mr temple boyle n a the class instructor and he 
imagined there would be an opening address of some kind but the instructor merely announced 
that mr william ray had been appointed monitor and that he hoped that there would 
be no disorder or wasting of time there would be regular criticism days by himwednesdays 
and fridays he hoped that each pupil would be able to show marked improvement the 
class would now begin work then he strolled out eugene soon learned from one of 
the students that this really was mr boyle the young irish girl had gone behind 
the screen eugene could see partially from where he was sitting that she was disrobing 
it shocked him a little but he kept his courage and his countenance because of 
the presence of so many others he turned a chair upside down as he saw 
the others do and sat down on a stool his charcoal was lying in a 
little box beside him he straightened his paper on its board and fidgeted keeping as 
still as he could some of the students were talking suddenly he saw the girl 
divest herself of a thin gauze shirt and the next moment she came out naked 
and composed to step upon the platform and stand perfectly erect her arms by her 
side her head thrown back eugene tingled and blushed and was almost afraid to look 
directly at her then he took a stick of charcoal and began sketching feebly attempting 
to convey something of this personality and this pose to paper it seemed a wonderful 
thing for him to be doingto be in this room to see this girl posing 
so in short to be an art student so this was what it was a 
world absolutely different from anything he had ever known and he was selfcalled to be 
a member of it chapter vii it was after he had decided to enter the 
art class that eugene paid his first visit to his family though they were only 
a hundred miles away he had never felt like going back even at christmas now 
it seemed to him he had something definite to proclaim he was going to be 
an artist and as to his work he was getting along well in that mr 
mitchly appeared to like him it was to mr mitchly that he reported daily with 
his collections and his unsatisfied bills the collections were checked up by mr mitchly with 
the cash and the unpaid bills certified sometimes eugene made a mistake having too much 
or too little but the too much was always credited against the too little so 
that in the main he came out even in money matters there was no tendency 
on eugene's part to be dishonest he thought of lots of things he wanted but 
he was fairly well content to wait and come by them legitimately it was this 
note in him that appealed to mitchly he thought that possibly something could be made 
of eugene in a trade way he left the friday night preceding labor day the 
first monday in september which was a holiday throughout the city he had told mr 
mitchly that he thought of leaving saturday after work for over sunday and monday but 
mr mitchly suggested that he might double up his saturday's work with thursday's and friday's 
if he wished and go friday evening saturday's a short day anyhow he said that 
would give three days at home and still you wouldn't be behind in your work 
eugene thanked his employer and did as suggested he packed his bag with the best 
he had in the way of clothes and journeyed homeward wondering how he would find 
things how different it all was stella was gone his youthful unsophistication had passed he 
could go home as a city man with some prospects he had no idea of 
how boyish he lookedhow much the idealist he washow far removed from hard practical judgment 
which the world values so highly when the train reached alexandria his father and myrtle 
and sylvia were at the depot to greet himthe latter with her two year old 
son they had all come down in the family carryall which left one seat for 
eugene he greeted them warmly and received their encomiums on his looks with a befitting 
sense of humility you're bigger his father exclaimed you're going to be a tall man 
after all eugene i was afraid you had stopped growing i hadn't noticed that i 
had grown any said eugene ah yes put in myrtle you're much bigger gene it 
makes you look a little thinner are you good and strong i ought to be 
laughed eugene i walk about fifteen or twenty miles a day and i'm out in 
the air all the time if i don't get strong now i never will sylvia 
asked him about his stomach trouble about the same he told her sometimes he thought 
it was better sometimes worse a doctor had told him to drink hot water in 
the morning but he didn't like to do it it was so hard to swallow 
the stuff while they were talking asking questions they reached the front gate of the 
house and mrs witla came out on the front porch eugene at sight of her 
in the late dusk jumped over the front wheel and ran to meet her little 
ma he exclaimed didn't expect me back so soon did you so soon she said 
her arms around his neck then she held him so quite still for a few 
moments you're getting to be a big man she said when she released him he 
went into the old sitting room and looked around it was all quite the sameno 
change there were the same books the same table the same chairs the same pulley 
lamp hanging from the center of the ceiling in the parlor there was nothing new 
nor in the bed rooms or the kitchen his mother looked a little olderhis father 
not sylvia had changed greatlybeing slightly peaked in the face compared to her former plumpness 
it was due to motherhood he thought myrtle seemed a little more calm and happy 
she had a real steady now frank bangs the superintendent of the local furniture factory 
he was quite young goodlooking going to be welloff some day so they thought old 
bill one of the big horses had been sold rover one of the two collies 
was dead jake the cat had been killed in a night brawl somewhere somehow as 
eugene stood in the kitchen watching his mother fry a big steak and make biscuits 
and gravy in honor of his coming he felt that he did not belong to 
this world any more it was smaller narrower than he had ever thought the town 
had seemed smaller as he had come through its streets the houses too and yet 
it was nice the yards were sweet and simple but countrified his father running a 
sewing machine business seemed tremendously limited he had a country or small town mind it 
struck eugene as curious now that they had never had a piano and myrtle liked 
music too as for himself he had learned that he was passionately fond of it 
there were organ recitals in the central music hall of chicago on tuesday and friday 
afternoons and he had managed to attend some after his work there were great preachers 
like prof swing and the rev h w thomas and the rev f w gunsaulus 
and prof saltus liberal thinkers all whose public services in the city were always accompanied 
by lovely music eugene had found all these men and their services in his search 
for life and to avoid being lonely now they had taught him that his old 
world was no world at all it was a small town he would never come 
to this any more after a sound night's rest in his old room he went 
down the next day to see mr caleb williams at the appeal office and mr 
burgess and jonas lyle and john summers as he went on the court house square 
he met ed mitchell and george taps and will groniger and four or five others 
whom he had known in school from them he learned how things were it appeared 
that george anderson had married a local girl and was in chicago working out in 
the stock yards ed waterbury had gone to san francisco the pretty sampson girl bessie 
sampson who had once gone with ted martinwood so much had run away with a 
man from anderson indiana there had been a lot of talk about it at the 
time eugene listened it all seemed less though than the new world that he had 
entered of these fellows none knew the visions that were now surging in his brain 
parisno lessand new yorkby what far route he could scarcely tell and will groniger had 
got to be a baggage clerk at one of the two depots and was proud 
of it good heavens at the office of the appeal things were unchanged somehow eugene 
had had the feeling that two years would make a lot of difference whereas the 
difference was in him only he was the one who had undergone cataclysmic changes he 
had a been a stove polisher a real estate assistant a driver and a collector 
he had known margaret duff and mr redwood of the laundry and mr mitchly the 
great city had dawned on him verestchagin and bouguereau and the art institute he was 
going on at one pace the town was moving at another onea slower but quite 
as fast as it had ever gone caleb williams was there skipping about as of 
yore cheerful communicative interested i'm glad to see you back eugene he declared fixing him 
with the one good eye which watered i'm glad you're getting alongthat's fine going to 
be an artist eh well i think that's what you were cut out for i 
wouldn't advise every young fellow to go to chicago but that's where you belong if 
it wasn't for my wife and three children i never would have left it when 
you get a wife and family though he paused and shook his head i gad 
you got to do the best you can then he went to look up some 
missing copy jonas lyle was as portly phlegmatic and philosophic as ever he greeted eugene 
with a solemn eye in which there was inquiry well how is it he asked 
eugene smiled oh pretty good not going to be a printer then no i think 
not well it's just as well there're an awful lot of them while they were 
talking john summers sidled up how are you mr witla he inquired eugene looked at 
him john was certainly marked for the grave in the near future he was thinner 
of a bluishgrey color bent at the shoulders why i'm fine mr summers eugene said 
i'm not so good said the old printer he tapped his chest significantly this thing's 
getting the best of me don't you believe it put in lyle john's always gloomy 
he's just as good as ever i tell him he'll live twenty years yet no 
no said summers shaking his head i know he left after a bit to go 
across the street his customary drinking excuse he can't last another year lyle observed the 
moment the door was closed burgess only keeps him because it would be a shame 
to turn him out but he's done for anyone can see that said eugene he 
looks terrible so they talked at noon he went home myrtle announced that he was 
to come with her and mr bangs to a party that evening there were going 
to be games and refreshments it never occurred to him that in this town there 
had never been dancing among the boys and girls he moved with and scarcely any 
music people did not have pianosor at least only a few of them after supper 
mr bangs called and the three of them went to a typical small town party 
it was not much different from the ones eugene had attended with stella except that 
the participants were in the main just that much older two years make a great 
deal of difference in youth there were some twentytwo young men and women all crowded 
into three fair sized rooms and on a porch the windows and doors leading to 
which were open outside were brown grass and some autumn flowers early crickets were chirping 
and there were late fireflies it was warm and pleasant the opening efforts to be 
sociable were a little stiff there were introductions all around much smart badinage among town 
dandies for most of them were here there were a number of new facesgirls who 
had moved in from other towns or blossomed into maturity since eugene had left if 
you'll marry me madge i'll buy you a nice new pair of seal skin earrings 
he heard one of the young bloods remark eugene smiled and the girl laughed back 
he always thinks he's so cute it was almost impossible for eugene to break through 
the opening sense of reserve which clogged his actions at everything in the way of 
social diversion he was a little nervous because he was afraid of criticism that was 
his vanity and deep egotism he stood about trying to get into the swing of 
the thing with a bright remark or two just as he was beginning to bubble 
a girl came in from one of the other rooms eugene had not met her 
she was with his prospective brotherinlaw bangs and was laughing in a sweet joyous way 
which arrested his attention she was dressed in white he noticed with a band of 
golden brown ribbon pulled through the loops above the flounces at the bottom of her 
dress her hair was a wonderful ashen yellow a great mass of itand laid in 
big thick braids above her forehead and ears her nose was straight her lips were 
thin and red her cheekbones faintly but curiously noticeable somehow there was a sense of 
distinction about hera faint aroma of personality which eugene did not understand it appealed to 
him bangs brought her over he was a tight smiling youth as sound as oak 
as clear as good water here's miss blue eugene she's from up in wisconsin and 
comes down to chicago occasionally i told her you ought to know her you might 
meet up there sometime say but that's good luck isn't it smiled eugene i'm sure 
i'm glad to know you what part of wisconsin do you come from blackwood she 
laughed her greenishblue eyes dancing her hair is yellow her eyes are blue and she 
comes from blackwood commented bangs how's that his big mouth with its even teeth was 
wide with a smile you left out the blue name and the white dress she 
ought to wear white all the time oh it does harmonize with my name doesn't 
it she cried at home i do wear white mostly you see i'm just a 
country girl and i make most of my things did you make that asked eugene 
of course i did bangs moved away a little looking at her as if critically 
well that's really pretty he pronounced mr bangs is such a flatterer she smiled at 
eugene he doesn't mean any thing he says he just tells me one thing after 
another he's right said eugene i agree as to the dress and it fits the 
hair wonderfully you see he's lost too laughed bangs that's the way they all do 
well i'm going to leave you two i've got to get back i left your 
sister in the hands of a rival of mine eugene turned to this girl and 
laughed his reserved laugh i was just thinking what was going to become of me 
i've been away for two years and i've lost track of some of these people 
i'm worse yet i've only been here two weeks and i scarcely know anybody mrs 
king takes me around everywhere but it's all so new i can't get hold of 
it i think alexandria is lovely it is nice i suppose you've been out on 
the lakes oh yes we've fished and rowed and camped i have had a lovely 
time but i have to go back tomorrow do you said eugene why i do 
too i'm going to take the fourfifteen so am i she laughed perhaps we can 
go together why certainly that's fine i thought i'd have to go back alone i 
only came down for over sunday i've been working up in chicago they fell to 
telling each other their histories she was from blackwood only eightyfive miles from chicago and 
had lived there all her life there were several brothers and sisters her father was 
evidently a farmer and politician and what not and eugene gleaned from stray remarks that 
they must be well thought of though poor one brotherinlaw was spoken of as a 
banker another as the owner of a grain elevator she herself was a school teacher 
at blackwoodhad been for several years eugene did not realize it but she was fully 
five years older than himself with the tact and the superior advantage which so much 
difference in years brings she was tired of schoolteaching tired of caring for the babies 
of married sisters tired of being left to work and stay at home when the 
ideal marrying age was rapidly passing she was interested in able people and silly village 
boys did not appeal to her there was one who was begging her to marry 
him at this moment but he was a slow soul up in blackwood not actually 
worthy of her nor able to support her well she was hopefully sadly vaguely madly 
longing for something better and as yet nothing had ever turned up this meeting with 
eugene was not anything which promised a way out to her she was not seeking 
so urgentlynor did she give introductions that sort of a twist in her consciousness but 
this young man had an appeal for her beyond anyone she had met recently they 
were in sympathetic accord apparently she liked his clear big eyes his dark hair his 
rather waxen complexion he seemed something better than she had known and she hoped that 
he would be nice to her chapter viii the rest of that evening eugene spent 
not exactly with but near miss bluemiss angela blue as he found her name to 
be he was interested in her not so much from the point of view of 
looks though she was charming enough but because of some peculiarity of temperament which lingered 
with him as a grateful taste might dwell on the palate he thought her young 
and was charmed by what he considered her innocence and unsophistication as a matter of 
fact she was not so much young and unsophisticated as an unconscious simulator of simplicity 
in the conventional sense she was a thoroughly good girl loyal financially honest truthful in 
all commonplace things and thoroughly virtuous moreover in that she considered marriage and children the 
fate and duty of all women having had so much trouble with other peoples' children 
she was not anxious to have any or at least many of her own of 
course she did not believe that she would escape with what seemed to be any 
such good fortune she fancied that she would be like her sisters the wife of 
a good business or professional man the mother of three or four or five healthy 
children the keeper of an ideal middle class home the handmaiden of her husband's needs 
there was a deep current of passion in her which she had come to feel 
would never be satisfied no man would ever understand no man at least whom she 
was likely to meet but she knew she had a great capacity to love if 
someone would only come along and arouse thatbe worthy of itwhat a whirlwind of affection 
she would return to him how she would love how sacrifice but it seemed now 
that her dreams were destined never to be fulfilled because so much time had slipped 
by and she had not been courted by the right one so here she was 
now at twentyfive dreaming and longingthe object of her ideals thus accidentally brought before her 
and no immediate consciousness that that was the case it does not take sexual affinity 
long to manifest itself once its subjects are brought near to each other eugene was 
older in certain forms of knowledge broader in a sense potentially greater than she would 
ever comprehend but nevertheless swayed helplessly by emotion and desire her own emotions though perhaps 
stronger than his were differently aroused the stars the night a lovely scene any exquisite 
attribute of nature could fascinate him to the point of melancholy with her nature in 
its largest aspects passed practically unnoticed she responded to music feelingly as did eugene in 
literature only realism appealed to him for her sentiment strained though not necessarily unreal had 
the greatest charm art in its purely æsthetic forms meant nothing at all to her 
to eugene it was the last word in the matter of emotional perception history philosophy 
logic psychology were sealed books to her to eugene they were already open doors or 
better yet flowery paths of joy down which he was wandering yet in spite of 
these things they were being attracted toward each other and there were other differences with 
eugene convention meant nothing at all and his sense of evil and good was something 
which the ordinary person would not have comprehended he was prone to like all sorts 
and conditions of human beingsthe intellectual the ignorant the clean the dirty the gay the 
sorrowful white yellow black as for angela she had a distinct preference for those who 
conducted themselves according to given standards of propriety she was brought up to think of 
those people as best who worked the hardest denied themselves the most and conformed to 
the ordinary notions of right and wrong there was no questioning of current standards in 
her mind as it was written socially and ethically upon the tables of the law 
so was it there might be charming characters outside the pale but they were not 
admitted to association or sympathy to eugene a human being was a human being the 
ruck of misfits or ne'erdowells he could laugh joyously with or at it was all 
wonderful beautiful amusing even its grimness and tragedy were worth while although they hurt him 
terribly at times why under these circumstances he should have been so thoroughly attracted to 
angela remains a mystery perhaps they complemented each other at this time as a satellite 
complements a larger luminaryfor eugene's egoism required praise sympathy feminine coddling and angela caught fire 
from the warmth and geniality of his temperament on the train next day eugene had 
nearly three hours of what he deemed most delightful talk with her they had not 
journeyed far before he had told her how he had traveled this way on this 
train at this hour two years before how he had walked about the streets of 
the big city looking for a place to sleep how he had got work and 
stayed away until he felt that he had found himself now he was going to 
study art and then to new york or paris and do magazine illustrating and possibly 
paint pictures he was truly your flamboyant youth of talent when he got to talkingwhen 
he had a truly sympathetic ear he loved to boast to someone who really admired 
him and he felt that he had admiration here angela looked at him with swimming 
eyes he was really different from anything she had ever known young artistic imaginative ambitious 
he was going out into a world which she had longed for but never hoped 
to seethat of art here he was telling her of his prospective art studies and 
talking of paris what a wonderful thing as the train neared chicago she explained that 
she would have to make an almost immediate connection with one which left over the 
chicago milwaukee and st paul for blackwood she was a little lonely to tell the 
truth a little sick at heart for the summer vacation was over and she was 
going back to teach school alexandria for the two weeks she had been there visiting 
mrs king formerly a blackwood girl and schoolday chum of hers was lovely her girlhood 
friend had tried to make things most pleasant and now it was all over even 
eugene was over for he said nothing much of seeing her again or had not 
so far she was wishing she might see more of this world he painted in 
such glowing colors when he said: mr bangs said that you come down to chicago 
every now and then i do she replied i sometimes come down to go to 
the theatres and shop she did not say that there was an element of practical 
household commercialism in it for she was considered one of the best buyers in the 
family and that she was sent to buy by various members of the family in 
quantities from a practical household point of view she was a thoroughbred and was valued 
by her sisters and friends as someone who loved to do things she might have 
come to be merely a family pack horse solely because she loved to work it 
was instinct to do everything she did thoroughly but she worked almost exclusively in minor 
household matters how soon do you expect to come down again he asked oh i 
can't tell i sometimes come down when opera is on in the winter i may 
be here around thanksgiving not before that i don't think so she replied archly that's 
too bad i thought maybe i'd see you a few times this fall when you 
do come i wish you could let me know i'd like to take you to 
the theatre eugene spent precious little money on any entertainment but he thought he could 
venture this she would not be down often then too he had the notion that 
he might get a rise one of these daysthat would make a difference when she 
came again he would be in art school opening up another field for himself life 
looked hopeful that's so nice of you she replied and when i come i'll let 
you know i'm just a country girl she added with a toss of her head 
and i don't get to the city often eugene liked what he considered the guileless 
naïveté of her confessionsthe frankness with which she owned up to simplicity and poverty most 
girls didn't she almost made a virtue out of these thingat least they were charming 
as a confession in her i'll hold you to that he assured her oh you 
needn't i'll be glad to let you know they were nearing the station he forgot 
for the moment that she was not as remote and delicate in her beauty as 
stella that she was apparently not as passionate temperamentally as margaret he saw her wonderfully 
dull hair and her thin lips and peculiar blue eyes and admired her honesty and 
simplicity he picked up her grip and helped her to find her train when they 
came to part he pressed her hand warmly for she had been very nice to 
him so attentive and sympathetic and interested now remember he said gaily after he had 
put her in her seat in the local i won't forget you wouldn't mind if 
i wrote you now and then not at all i'd like it then i will 
he said and went out he stood outside and looked at her through the train 
window as it pulled out he was glad to have met her this was the 
right sort of girl clean honest simple attractive that was the way the best women 
weregood and purenot wild pieces of fire like margaret nor unconscious indifferent beauties like stella 
he was going to add but couldn't there was a voice within him that said 
that artistically stella was perfect and even now it hurt him a little to remember 
but stella was gone forever there was no doubt about that during the days that 
followed he thought of the girl often he wondered what sort of a town blackwood 
was what sort of people she moved with what sort of a house she lived 
in they must be nice simple people like his own in alexandria these types of 
city bred people whom he sawgirls particularlyand those born to wealth had no appeal for 
him as yet they were too distant too far removed from anything he could aspire 
to a good woman such as miss blue obviously was must be a treasure anywhere 
in the world he kept thinking he would write to herhe had no other girl 
acquaintance now and just before he entered art school he did this penning a little 
note saying that he remembered so pleasantly their ride and when was she coming her 
answer after a week was that she expected to be in the city about the 
middle or the end of october and that she would be glad to have him 
call she gave him the number of an aunt who lived out on the north 
side in ohio street and said she would notify him further she was hard at 
work teaching school now and didn't even have time to think of the lovely summer 
she had had poor little girl he thought she deserved a better fate when she 
comes i'll surely look her up he thought and there was a lot that went 
with the idea such wonderful hair chapter ix the succeeding days in the art school 
after his first admission revealed many new things to eugene he understood now or thought 
he did why artists were different from the rank and file of mankind this art 
institute atmosphere was something so refreshing after his days rambling among poor neighborhoods collecting that 
he could hardly believe that he eugene witla belonged there these were exceptional young people 
some of them anyhow if they weren't cut out to be good artists they still 
had imaginationthe dream of the artist they came as eugene gradually learned from all parts 
of the west and south from chicago and st louisfrom kansas nebraska and iowafrom texas 
and california and minnesota one boy was in from saskatchewan of the canadian north west 
another from the then territory of new mexico because his name was gill they called 
him the gila monsterthe difference in the pronunciation of the g's not troubling them at 
all a boy who came down from minnesota was a farmer's son and talked about 
going back to plow and sow and reap during the next spring and summer another 
boy was the son of a kansas city millionaire the mechanics of drawing interested eugene 
from the first he learned the first night that there was some defect in his 
understanding of light and shade as it related to the human form he could not 
get any roundness or texture in his drawings the darkest shadow is always closest to 
the high light observed his instructor laconically on wednesday evening looking over his shoulder you're 
making everything a dull even tone so that was it you're drawing this figure as 
a bricklayer who isn't an architect might start to build a house you're laying bricks 
without having a plan where's your plan the voice was that of mr boyle looking 
over his shoulder eugene looked up he had begun to draw the head only a 
plan a plan said his instructor making a peculiar motion with his hands which described 
the outline of the pose in a single motion get your general lines first then 
you can put in the details afterward eugene saw at once another time his instructor 
was watching him draw the female breast he was doing it woodenlywithout much beauty of 
contour they're round they're round i tell you exclaimed boyle if you ever see any 
square ones let me know this caught eugene's sense of humor it made him laugh 
even though he flushed painfully for he knew he had a lot to learn the 
cruelest thing he heard this man say was to a boy who was rather thick 
and fat but conscientious you can't draw he said roughly take my advice and go 
home you'll make more money driving a wagon the class winced but this man was 
ugly in his intolerance of futility the idea of anybody wasting his time was obnoxious 
to him he took art as a business man takes business and he had no 
time for the misfit the fool or the failure he wanted his class to know 
that art meant effort aside from this brutal insistence on the significance of art there 
was another side to the life which was not so hard and in a way 
more alluring between the twentyfive minute poses which the model took there were some four 
or five minute rests during the course of the evening in which the students talked 
relighted their pipes and did much as they pleased sometimes students from other classes came 
in for a few moments the thing that astonished eugene though was the freedom of 
the model with the students and the freedom of the students with her after the 
first few weeks he observed some of those who had been there the year before 
going up to the platform where the girl sat and talking with her she had 
a little pink gauze veil which she drew around her shoulders or waist that instead 
of reducing the suggestiveness of her attitudes heightened them say ain't that enough to make 
everything go black in front of your eyes said one boy sitting next to eugene 
well i guess he laughed there's some edge to that the boys would sit and 
laugh and jest with this girl and she would laugh and coquette in return he 
saw her strolling about looking at some of the students' drawings of her over their 
shoulders standing face to face with othersand so calmly the strong desire which it invariably 
aroused in eugene he quelled and concealed for these things were not to be shown 
on the surface once while he was looking at some photographs that a student had 
brought she came and looked over his shoulder this little flower of the streets her 
body graced by the thin scarf her lips and cheeks red with color she came 
so close that she leaned against his shoulder and arm with her soft flesh it 
pulled him tense like a great current but he made no sign pretending that it 
was the veriest commonplace several times because the piano was there and because students would 
sing and play in the interludes she came and sat on the piano stool herself 
strumming out an accompaniment to which some one or three or four would sing somehow 
this of all things seemed most sensuous to himmost oriental it set him wild he 
felt his teeth click without volition on his part when she resumed her pose his 
passion subsided for then the cold æsthetic value of her beauty became uppermost it was 
only the incidental things that upset him in spite of these disturbances eugene was gradually 
showing improvement as a draughtsman and an artist he liked to draw the figure he 
was not as quick at that as he was at the more varied outlines of 
landscapes and buildings but he could give lovely sensuous touches to the human formparticularly to 
the female formwhich were beginning to be impressive he'd got past the place where boyle 
had ever to say they're round he gave a sweep to his lines that attracted 
the instructor's attention you're getting the thing as a whole i see he said quietly 
one day eugene thrilled with satisfaction another wednesday he said:a little colder my boy a 
little colder there's sex in that it isn't in the figure you ought to make 
a good mural decorator some day if you have the inclination boyle went on you've 
got the sense of beauty the roots of eugene's hair tingled so art was coming 
to him this man saw his capacity he really had art in him one evening 
a paper sign pasted up on the bulletin board bore the significant legend: artists attention 
we eat we eat nov th at sofroni's all those who want to get in 
give their names to the monitor eugene had heard nothing of this but he judged 
that it originated in one of the other classes he spoke to the monitor and 
learned that only seventyfive cents was required of him students could bring girls if they 
wished most of them would he decided that he would go but where to get 
a girl sofroni's was an italian restaurant in lower clark street which had originally started 
out as an eating place for italian laborers because it was near an italian boarding 
house section it was located in an old house that was not exactly homely a 
yard in the back had been set with plain wooden tables and benches had been 
placed for use in the summer time and later this had been covered with a 
mouldy tentcloth to protect the diners from rain still later this became glass and was 
used in winter the place was clean and the food good some struggling craftsman in 
journalism and art had found it and by degrees signor sofroni had come to realize 
that he was dealing with a better element he began to exchange greetings with these 
people to set aside a little corner for them finally he entertained a small group 
of them at dinnercharging them hardly more than cost priceand so he was launched one 
student told another sofroni now had his yard covered in so that he could entertain 
a hundred at dinner even in winter he could serve several kinds of wines and 
liquors with a dinner for seventyfive cents a piece so he was popular the dinner 
was the culmination of several other class treats it was the custom of a class 
whenever a stranger or even a new member appeared to yell treat treat at which 
the victim or new member was supposed to produce two dollars as a contribution to 
a beer fund if the money was not producedthe stranger was apt to be thrown 
out or some ridiculous trick played upon himif it was forthcoming work for the evening 
ceased a collection was immediately taken up kegs of beer were sent for with sandwiches 
and cheese drinking singing piano playing jesting followed once to eugene's utter astonishment one of 
the studentsa big good natured carousing boy from omahalifted the nude model to his shoulders 
set her astride his neck and proceeded around the room jigging as he wentthe girl 
meantime pulling his black hair the other students following and shouting uproariously some of the 
girls in an adjoining room studying in an evening life class stopped their work to 
peep through a half dozen small holes which had been punched in the intervening partition 
the sight of showalter carrying the girl so astonished the eavesdroppers that the news of 
it was soon all over the building knowledge of the escapade reached the secretary and 
the next day the student was dropped but the bacchic dance had been enactedits impression 
was left there were other treats like this in which eugene was urged to drink 
and he dida very little he had no taste for beer he also tried to 
smoke but he did not care for it he could become nervously intoxicated at times 
by the mere sight of such revelry and then he grew witty easy in his 
motions quick to say bright things on one of these occasions one of the models 
said to him: why you're nicer than i thought i imagined you were very solemn 
oh no he said only at times you don't know me he seized her about 
the waist but she pushed him away he wished now that he danced for he 
saw that he might have whirled her about the room then and there he decided 
to learn at once the question of a girl for the dinner troubled him he 
knew of no one except margaret and he did not know that she danced there 
was miss blue of blackwoodwhom he had seen when she made her promised visit to 
the citybut the thought of her in connection with anything like this was to him 
incongruous he wondered what she would think if she saw such scenes as he had 
witnessed it chanced that one day when he was in the members' room he met 
miss kenny the girl whom he had seen posing the night he had entered the 
school eugene remembered her fascination for she was the first nude model he had ever 
seen and she was pretty she was also the one who had come and stood 
by him when she was posing he had not seen her since then she had 
liked eugene but he had seemed a little distant and at first a little commonplace 
lately he had taken to a loose flowing tie and a soft round hat which 
became him he turned his hair back loosely and emulated the independent swing of mr 
temple boyle that man was a sort of god to himstrong and successful to be 
like that the girl noted a change for what she deemed the better he was 
so nice now she thought so whiteskinned and cleareyed and keen she pretended to be 
looking at the drawing of a nude when she saw him how are you he 
asked smiling venturing to speak to her because he was lonely and because he knew 
no other girl she turned gaily and returned the question facing him with smiling lips 
and genial eyes i haven't seen you for some time he said are you back 
here now for this week she said i'm doing studio work i don't care for 
classes when i can get the other i thought you liked them he replied recalling 
her gaiety of mood oh i don't dislike it only studio work is better we've 
missed you he said the others haven't been nearly as nice aren't you complimentary she 
laughed her black eyes looking into his with a twinkle no it's so he returned 
and then asked hopefully are you going to the dinner on the th maybe she 
said i haven't made up my mind it all depends on what on how i 
feel and who asks me i shouldn't think there'd be any trouble about that he 
observed if i had a girl i'd go he went on making a terrific effort 
to reach the point where he could ask her she saw his intention well she 
laughed would you go with me he ventured thus so shamelessly assisted sure she said 
for she liked him that's fine he exclaimed where do you live i'll want to 
know that he searched for a pencil she gave him her number on west fiftyseventh 
street because of his collecting he knew the neighborhood it was a street of shabby 
frame houses far out on the south side he remembered great mazes of trade near 
it and unpaved streets and open stretches of wet prairie land somehow it seemed fitting 
to him that this little flower of the muck and coal yard area should be 
a model i'll be sure and get you he laughed you won't forget will you 
miss just ruby she interrupted ruby kenny it's a pretty name isn't it he said 
it's euphonious you wouldn't let me come out some sunday and see just where it 
is yes you may she replied pleased by his comment on her name i'm home 
most every sunday come out next sunday afternoon if you want to i will said 
eugene he walked out to the street with her in a very buoyant mood chapter 
x ruby kenny was the adopted child of an old irish laborer and his wife 
who had taken her from a quarrelling couple when they had practically deserted her at 
the age of four years she was bright good natured not at all informed as 
to the social organization of the world just a simple little girl with a passion 
for adventure and no saving insight which would indicate beforehand whither adventure might lead she 
began life as a cash girl in a department store and was spoiled of her 
virtue at fifteen she was rather fortunate in that her smartness attracted the rather superior 
capable selfprotecting type of man and these were fortunate too in that she was not 
utterly promiscuous appetite with her waiting on strong liking and in one or two cases 
real affection and culminating only after a period of dalliance which made her as much 
a victim of her moods as were her lovers her foster parents provided no guidance 
of any intelligent character they liked her and since she was brighter than they were 
submitted to her rule her explanations of conduct her taste she waved aside with a 
laughing rejoinder any slight objections they might make and always protested that she did not 
care what the neighbors thought the visits which eugene paid and the companionship which ensued 
were of a piece with every other relationship of this character which he ever entered 
into he worshiped beauty as beauty and he never wholly missed finding a certain quality 
of mind and heart for which he longed he sought in women besides beauty good 
nature and sympathy he shunned criticism and coldness and was never apt to select for 
a sweetheart anyone who could outshine him either in emotion or rapidity or distinction of 
ideas he liked at this time simple things simple homes simple surroundings the commonplace atmosphere 
of simple life for the more elegant and imposing overawed him the great mansions which 
he saw the great trade structures the great significant personalities seemed artificial and cold he 
liked little peoplepeople who were not known but who were sweet and kindly in their 
moods if he could find female beauty with anything like that as a background he 
was happy and settled down near it if he could in comfort his drawing near 
to ruby was governed by this mood the sunday eugene called it rained and the 
neighborhood in which she lived was exceedingly dreary looking around here and there one could 
see in the open spaces between the houses pools of water standing in the brown 
dead grass he had crossed a great maze of black cindered car tracks where engines 
and cars were in great masses and speculated on the drawings such scenes would makebig 
black engines throwing up clouds of smoke and steam in a grey wet air great 
mazes of particolored cars dank in the rain but lovely at night the switch lights 
in these great masses of yards bloomed like flowers he loved the sheer yellows reds 
greens blues that burned like eyes here was the stuff that touched him magnificently and 
somehow he was glad that this raw flowering girl lived near something like this when 
he reached the door and rang the bell he was greeted by an old shaky 
irishamerican who seemed to him rather low in the scale of intelligencethe kind of a 
man who would make a good crossing guard perhaps he had on common characterful clothes 
the kind that from long wear have taken the natural outlines of the body in 
his fingers was a short pipe which he had been smoking is miss kenny in 
eugene inquired yus said the man come in i'll git her he poked back through 
a typical workingman's parlor to a rear room someone had seen to it that almost 
everything in the room was redthe big silkshaded lamp the family album the carpet and 
the red flowered wall paper while he was waiting he opened the album and looked 
at what he supposed were her relativescommonplace people allclerks salesmen storekeepers presently ruby came and 
then his eye lighted for there was about her a smartness of youthshe was not 
more than nineteenwhich captivated his fancy she had on a black cashmere dress with touches 
of red velvet at the neck and elsewhere and she wore a loose red tie 
much as a boy might she looked gay and cheerful and held out her hand 
did you have much trouble in getting here she asked he shook his head i 
know this country pretty well i collect all through here week days i work for 
the peoples' furniture company you know oh then it's all right she said enjoying his 
frankness i thought you'd have a hard time finding it it's a pretty bad day 
isn't it eugene admitted that it was but commented on the car tracks he had 
seen if i could paint at all i'd like to paint those things they're so 
big and wonderful he went to the window and gazed out at the neighborhood ruby 
watched him with interest his movements were pleasing to her she felt at home in 
his companyas though she were going to like him very much it was so easy 
to talk to him there were the classes her studio work his own career this 
neighborhood to give her a feeling of congeniality with him are there many big studios 
in chicago he asked when they finally got around to that phase of her work 
he was curious to know what the art life of the city was no not 
so very manynot at least of the good ones there are a lot of fellows 
who think they can paint who are the big ones he asked well i only 
know by what i hear artists say mr rose is pretty good byam jones is 
pretty fine on genre subjects so they say walter low is a good portrait painter 
and so is manson steele and let's seethere's arthur biggshe does landscapes only i've never 
been in his studio and finley wood he's another portrait man and wilson brooks he 
does figuresoh i don't know there are quite a number eugene listened entranced this patter 
of art matters was more in the way of definite information about personalities than he 
had heard during all the time he had been in the city the girl knew 
these things she was in the movement he wondered what her relationship to these various 
people was he got up after a time and looked out of the window again 
she came also it's not very nice around here she explained but papa and mamma 
like to live here it's near papa's work was that your father i met at 
the door they're not my real parents she explained i'm an adopted child they're just 
like real parents to me though i certainly owe them a lot you can't have 
been posing in art very long said eugene thoughtfully thinking of her age no i 
only began about a year ago she told how she had been a clerk in 
the fair and how she and another girl had got the idea from seeing articles 
in the sunday papers there was once a picture in the tribune of a model 
posing in the nude before the local life class this had taken her eye and 
she had consulted with the other girl as to whether they had not better try 
posing too her friend like herself was still posing she was coming to the dinner 
eugene listened entranced it reminded him of how he was caught by the picture of 
goose island in the chicago river of the little tumbledown huts and upturned hulls of 
boats used for homes he told her of that and of how he came and 
it touched her fancy she thought he was sentimental but niceand then he was big 
too and she was so much smaller you play he asked don't you oh just 
a little but we haven't got a piano i learned what i know by practising 
at the different studios do you dance asked eugene yes indeed she replied i wish 
i did he commented ruefully why don't you it's easy you could learn in no 
time i could teach you in a lesson i wish you would he said persuasively 
it isn't hard she went on moving away from him i can show you the 
steps they always begin with the waltz she lifted her skirts and exposed her little 
feet she explained what to do and how to do it he tried it alone 
but failed so she got him to put his arm around her and placed her 
hand in his now follow me she said it was so delightful to find her 
in his arms and she was apparently in no hurry to conclude the lesson for 
she worked with him quite patiently explaining the steps stopping and correcting him laughing at 
her mistakes and his you're getting it though she said after they had turned around 
a few times they had looked into each other's eyes a number of times and 
she gave him frank smiles in return for his he thought of the time when 
she stood by him in the studio looking over his shoulder surely surely this gap 
of formalities might be bridged over at once if he tried if he had the 
courage he pulled her a little closer and when they stopped he did not let 
go you're mighty sweet to me he said with an effort no i'm just good 
natured she laughed not endeavoring to break away he became emotionally tense as always she 
rather liked what seemed the superiority of his mood it was different stronger than was 
customary in the men she knew do you like me he asked looking at her 
she studied his face and hair and eyes i don't know she returned calmly are 
you sure you don't there was another pause in which she looked almost mockingly at 
him and then sobering away at the hall door yes i think i do she 
said he picked her up in his arms you're as cute as a doll he 
said and carried her to the red settee she spent the rest of the rainy 
afternoon resting in his arms and enjoying his kisses he was a new and peculiar 
kind of boy chapter xi a little while before angela blue at eugene's earnest solicitation 
had paid her first fall visit to chicago she had made a special effort to 
come lured by a certain poignancy of expression which he could give to any thought 
particularly when it concerned his desires in addition to the art of drawing he had 
the gift of writingvery slow in its development from a structural and interpretative point of 
view but powerful already on its descriptive side he could describe anything people houses horses 
dogs landscapes much as he could draw them and give a sense of tenderness and 
pathos in the bargain which was moving he could describe city scenes and the personal 
atmosphere which surrounded him in the most alluring fashion he had little time to write 
but he took it in this instance to tell this girl what he was doing 
and how he was doing it she was captivated by the quality of the world 
in which he was moving and the distinction of his own personality which he indicated 
rather indirectly than otherwise by contrast her own little world began to look very shabby 
indeed she came shortly after his art school opened and at her invitation he went 
out to the residence of her aunt on the north side a nice pleasant brick 
house in a quiet side street which had all the airs of middle class peace 
and comfort he was impressed with what seemed to him a sweet conservative atmospherea fitting 
domicile for a girl so dainty and refined as angela he paid his respects early 
saturday morning because her neighborhood happened to be in the direction of his work she 
played for himbetter than anyone he had ever known it seemed to him a great 
accomplishment her temperament attracted her to music of a high emotional order and to songs 
and instrumental compositions of indefinable sweetness in the half hour he stayed she played several 
things and he noted with a new pleasure her small shapely body in a dress 
of a very simple close fitting design her hair hung in two great braids far 
below her waist she reminded him the least bit of marguerite in faust he went 
again in the evening shining and eager and arrayed in his best he was full 
of the sense of his art prospects and happy to see her again for he 
was satisfied that he was going to fall in love with her she had a 
strong sympathetic attitude which allured him she wanted to be nice to this youthwanted him 
to like herand so the atmosphere was right that evening he took her to the 
chicago opera house where there was playing an extravaganza this fantasy so beautiful in its 
stagecraft so gorgeous in its show of costumes and pretty girls so idle in its 
humor and sweet in its love songs captivated both eugene and angela neither had been 
to a theatre for a long time both were en rapport with some such fantastic 
interpretation of existence after the short acquaintance at alexandria it was a nice coming together 
it gave point to their reunion after the performance he guided her through the surging 
crowds to a north division street carthey had laid cables since his arrivaland together they 
went over the beauties and humor of the thing they had seen he asked permission 
to call again next day and at the end of an afternoon in her company 
proposed that they go to hear a famous preacher who was speaking in central music 
hall evenings angela was pleased at eugene's resourcefulness she wanted to be with him this 
was a good excuse they went early and enjoyed it eugene liked the sermon as 
an expression of youth and beauty and power to command he would have liked to 
be an orator like that and he told angela so and he confided more and 
more of himself to her she was impressed by his vivid interest in life his 
selective power and felt that he was destined to be a notable personality there were 
other meetings she came again in early november and before christmas and eugene was fast 
becoming lost in the meshes of her hair although he met ruby in november and 
took up a tentative relation on a less spiritual basisas he would have said at 
the timehe nevertheless held this acquaintanceship with angela in the background as a superior and 
more significant thing she was purer than ruby there was in her certainly a deeper 
vein of feeling as expressed in her thoughts and music moreover she represented a country 
home something like his own a nice simple country town nice people why should he 
part with her or ever let her know anything of this other world that he 
touched he did not think he ought to he was afraid that he would lose 
her and he knew that she would make any man an ideal wife she came 
again in december and he almost proposed to herhe must not be free with her 
or draw too near too rapidly she made him feel the sacredness of love and 
marriage and he did propose in january the artist is a blend of subtleties in 
emotion which can not be classified no one woman could have satisfied all sides of 
eugene's character at that time beauty was the point with him any girl who was 
young emotional or sympathetic to the right degree and beautiful would have attracted and held 
him for a while he loved beautynot a plan of life he was interested in 
an artistic career not in the founding of a family girlhoodthe beauty of youthwas artistic 
hence he craved it angela's mental and emotional composition was stable she had learned to 
believe from childhood that marriage was a fixed thing she believed in one life and 
one love when you found that every other relationship which did not minister to it 
was ended if children came very good if not very good marriage was permanent anyhow 
and if you did not marry happily it was nevertheless your duty to endure and 
suffer for whatever good might remain you might suffer badly in such a union but 
it was dangerous and disgraceful to break it if you could not stand it any 
more your life was a failure of course eugene did not know what he was 
trifling with he had no conception of the nature of the relationship he was building 
up he went on blindly dreaming of this girl as an ideal and anticipating eventual 
marriage with her when that would be he had no idea for though his salary 
had been raised at christmas he was getting only eighteen dollars a week but he 
deemed it would come within a reasonable time meanwhile his visits to ruby had brought 
the inevitable result the very nature of the situation seemed to compel it she was 
young brimming over with a love of adventure admiring youth and strength in men eugene 
with his pale face which had just a touch of melancholy about it his sex 
magnetism his love of beauty appealed to her uncurbed passion was perhaps uppermost to begin 
with very shortly it was confounded with affection for this girl could love she was 
sweet good natured ignorant of life from many points of view eugene represented the most 
dramatic imagination she had yet seen she described to him the character of her foster 
parents told how simple they were and how she could do about as she pleased 
they did not know that she posed in the nude she confided to him her 
particular friendship for certain artists denying any present intimacies she admitted them in the past 
but asserted that they were bygones eugene really did not believe this he suspected her 
of meeting other approaches in the spirit in which she had met his own it 
aroused his jealousy and he wished at once that she were not a model he 
said as much and she laughed she knew he would act like that it was 
the first proof of real definite interest in her on his part from that time 
on there were lovely days and evenings spent in her company before the dinner she 
invited him over to breakfast one sunday her foster parents were to be away and 
she was to have the house to herself she wanted to cook eugene a breakfastprincipally 
to show him she could cookand then it was novel she waited till he arrived 
at nine to begin operations and then arrayed in a neat little lavender close fitting 
house dress and a ruffled white apron went about her work setting the table making 
biscuit preparing a kidney ragout with strong wine and making coffee eugene was delighted he 
followed her about delaying her work by taking her in his arms and kissing her 
she got flour on her nose and he brushed it off with his lips it 
was on this occasion that she showed him a very pleasing little dance she could 
doa clog dance which had a running sideways motion with frequent and rapid clicking of 
the heels she gathered her skirts a little way above her ankles and twinkled her 
feet through a maze of motions eugene was beside himself with admiration he told himself 
he had never met such a girlto be so clever at posing playing and dancing 
and so young he thought she would make a delightful creature to live with and 
he wished now he had money enough to make it possible at this highflown moment 
and at some others he thought he might almost marry her on the night of 
the dinner he took her to sofroni's and was surprised to find her arrayed in 
a red dress with a row of large black leather buttons cutting diagonally across the 
front she had on red stockings and shoes and wore a red carnation in her 
hair the bodice was cut low in the neck and the sleeves were short eugene 
thought she looked stunning and told her so she laughed they went in a cab 
for she had warned him beforehand that they would have to it cost him two 
dollars each way but he excused his extravagance on the ground of necessity it was 
little things like this that were beginning to make him think strongly of the problem 
of getting on the students who had got up this dinner were from all the 
art classes day and night there were over two hundred of them all of them 
young and there was a mixed collection of girl art students artist's models and girl 
friends of various grades of thought and condition who were brought as companions the big 
diningroom was tempestuous with the rattling of dishes the shouting of jests the singing of 
songs and the exchange of greetings eugene knew a few of these people outside his 
own classes enough to give him the chance to be sociable and not appear lonely 
or out of it from the outset it was apparent that she ruby was generally 
known and liked her costumea little boldmade her conspicuous from various directions there were cries 
of hey rube which was a familiar interpretation of her first name ruby eugene was 
surprised at thisit shocked him a little all sorts of boys he did not know 
came and talked to her exchanging familiar gossip she was called away from him a 
dozen times in as many minutes he saw her laughing and chatting at the other 
end of the hall surrounded by half a dozen students it made him jealous as 
the evening progressed the attitude of each toward the other and all toward anyone became 
more and more familiar when the courses were over a space was cleared at one 
end and a screen of green cloth rigged up in one corner as a dressing 
room for stunts eugene saw one of the students called with much applause to do 
an irish monologue wearing green whiskers which he adjusted in the presence of the crowd 
there was another youth who pretended to have with him an immense roll of versean 
epic no lesswound in so tight a manner that it looked as though it might 
take all night to read it the crowd groaned with amazing savoir faire he put 
up one hand for silence dropped the roll holding of course to the outer end 
and began reading it was not bad verse but the amusing part was that it 
was really short not more than twenty lines the rest of the paper had been 
covered with scribbling to deceive the crowd it secured a round of applause there was 
one secondyear man who sang a songdown in the lehigh valleyand another who gave imitations 
of temple boyle and other instructors at their work of criticising and painting for the 
benefit of the class these were greatly enjoyed finally one of the models after much 
calling by the crowd of desmond desmondher last namewent behind the green cloth screen and 
in a few moments reappeared in the short skirt of a spanish dancer with black 
and silver spangles and castanets some friendly student had brought a mandolin and la paloma 
was danced eugene had little of ruby's company during all these doings she was too 
much sought after as the other girl was concluding her dance he heard the cry 
of hey rube why don't you do your turn someone else eager to see her 
dance called come on ruby the rest of the room almost unthinkingly took it up 
some boys surrounding her had started to push her toward the dancing space before eugene 
knew it she was up in someone's arms being passed from group to group for 
a joke the crowd cheered eugene however having come so close to her was irritated 
by this familiarity she did not appear to belong to him but to the whole 
artstudent body and she was laughing when she was put down in the clear space 
she lifted her skirts as she had done for him and danced a crowd of 
students got very close he had to draw near to see her at all and 
there she was unconscious of him doing her gay clog dance when she stopped three 
or four of the more daring youths urged her seizing her by the hands and 
arms to do something else someone cleared a table and someone else picked her up 
and put her on it she did still other dances someone cried hey kenny do 
you need the red dress so this was his temporary sweetheart when she was finally 
ready to go home at four o'clock in the morning or when the others were 
agreed to let her go she hardly remembered that she had eugene with her she 
saw him waiting as two students were asking for the privilege of taking her home 
no she exclaimed seeing him i have my escort i'm going now goodbye and came 
toward him he felt rather frozen and out of it are you ready she asked 
he nodded gloomily reproachfully chapter xii from drawing from the nude which eugene came to 
do very successfully that winter his interest switched to his work in the illustration class 
where costume figures were used here for the first time he tried his hand at 
wash drawings the current medium for magazine work and was praised after a time for 
his execution not always however for the instructors feeling that harsh criticism would make for 
steadier effort poohpoohed some of his best work but he had faith in what he 
was destined to do and after sinking to depths of despair he would rise to 
great heights of selfconfidence his labor for the peoples' furniture company was becoming a rather 
dreary grind when vincent beers the instructor in the illustration class looking over his shoulder 
one wednesday afternoon said:you ought to be able to make a little money by your 
work pretty soon witla do you think so questioned eugene it's pretty good there ought 
to be a place on one of the newspapers here for a man like youan 
afternoon newspaper possibly did you ever try to get on i did when i first 
came to the city but they didn't want anyone i'm rather glad they didn't now 
i guess they wouldn't have kept me very long you draw in pen and ink 
pretty well don't you i thought i liked that best of all at first well 
then they ought to be able to use you i wouldn't stay very long at 
it though you ought to go to new york to get in the magazine illustration 
fieldthere's nothing out here but a little newspaper work now wouldn't hurt you eugene decided 
to try the afternoon papers for he knew that if he got work on one 
of these he could still continue his night classes he could give the long evening 
session to the illustration class and take an occasional night off to work on the 
life studies that would make an admirable arrangement for several days he took an hour 
after his work to make inquiry taking with him some examples of his pen and 
inks several of the men he saw liked what he had to show but he 
found no immediate opening there was only one paper one of the poorest that offered 
him any encouragement the editorinchief said he might be in need of a man shortly 
if eugene would come in again in three or four weeks he could tell him 
they did not pay very muchtwentyfive dollars to beginners eugene thought of this as a 
great opportunity and when he went back in three weeks and actually secured the place 
he felt that he was now fairly on the road to prosperity he was given 
a desk in a small back room on a fourth floor where there was accidentally 
west and north light he was in a department which held two other men both 
several years older than himself one of whom posed as dean of the staff the 
work here was peculiar in that it included not only pen and ink but the 
chalk plate process which was a method of drawing with a steel point upon a 
zinc plate covered with a deposit of chalk which left a design which was easily 
reproduced eugene had never done this he had to be shown by the dean but 
he soon picked it up he found it hard on his lungs for he had 
constantly to keep blowing the chalk away as he scratched the surface of the plate 
and sometimes the dust went up into his nostrils he hoped sincerely there would not 
be much of this work but there was rather an undue proportion at first owing 
to the fact that it was shouldered on to him by the other twohe being 
the beginner he suspected as much after a little time but by that time he 
was beginning to make friends with his companions and things were not so bad these 
two although they did not figure vastly in his life introduced him to conditions and 
personalities in the chicago newspaper world which broadened him and presented points of view which 
were helpful the elder of the two the dean was dressy and arty his name 
was horace howe the other jeremiah mathews jerry for short was short and fat with 
a round cheerful smiling countenance and a wealth of coarse black hair he loved chewing 
tobacco was a little mussy about his clothes but studious generous and good natured eugene 
found that he had several passions one for good food another for oriental curios and 
a third for archæology he was alive to all that was going on in the 
world and was utterly without any prejudices social moral or religious he liked his work 
and whistled or talked as he did it eugene took a secret like for him 
from the beginning it was while working on this paper that eugene first learned that 
he really could write it came about accidentally for he had abandoned the idea that 
he could ever do anything in newspaper work which was the field he had originally 
contemplated here there was great need for cheap sunday specials of a local character and 
in reading some of these which were given to him for illustration he came to 
the conclusion that he could do much better himself say he asked mathews who writes 
the articles in here he was looking over the sunday issue oh the reporters on 
the staffanyone that wants to i think they buy some from outsiders they only pay 
four dollars a column eugene wondered if they would pay him but pay or no 
pay he wanted to do them maybe they would let him sign his name he 
saw that some were signed he suggested he believed he could do that sort of 
thing but howe as a writer himself frowned on this he wrote and drew howe's 
opposition piqued eugene who decided to try when the opportunity offered he wanted to write 
about the chicago river which he thought he could illustrate effectively goose island because of 
the description he had read of it several years before the simple beauties of the 
city parks where he liked to stroll and watch the lovers on sundays there were 
many things but these stood as susceptible of delicious feeling illustration and he wanted to 
try his hand he suggested to the sunday editor mitchell goldfarb with whom he had 
become friendly that he thought something nice in an illustrative way could be done on 
the chicago river go ahead try your hand exclaimed that worthy who was a vigorous 
robust young american of about thirtyone with a gaspy laugh that sounded as if someone 
had thrown cold water down his back we need all that stuff can you write 
i sometimes think i might if i practiced a little why not went on the 
other who saw visions of a little free copy try your hand you might make 
a good thing of it if your writing is anything like your drawing it will 
be all right we don't pay people on the staff but you can sign your 
name to it this was enough for eugene he tried his hand at once his 
art work had already begun to impress his companions it was rough daring incisive with 
a touch of soul to it howe was already secretly envious mathews full of admiration 
encouraged thus by goldfarb eugene took a sunday afternoon and followed up the branches of 
the chicago river noting its wonders and peculiarities and finally made his drawings afterward he 
went to the chicago library and looked up its historyaccidentally coming across the reports of 
some government engineers who dwelt on the oddities of its traffic he did not write 
an article so much as a panegyric on its beauty and littleness finding the former 
where few would have believed it to exist goldfarb was oddly surprised when he read 
it he had not thought eugene could do it the charm of eugene's writing was 
that while his mind was full of color and poetry he had logic and a 
desire for facts which gave what he wrote stability he liked to know the history 
of things and to comment on the current phases of life he wrote of the 
parks goose island the bridewell whatever took his fancy his real passion was for art 
however it was a slightly easier medium for himquicker he thrilled to think sometimes that 
he could tell a thing in words and then actually draw it it seemed a 
beautiful privilege and he loved the thought of making the commonplace dramatic it was all 
dramatic to himthe wagons in the streets the tall buildings the street lampsanything everything his 
drawing was not neglected meantime but seemed to get stronger i don't know what there 
is about your stuff witla that gets me mathews said to him one day but 
you do something to it now why did you put those birds flying above that 
smokestack oh i don't know replied eugene it's just the way i feel about it 
i've seen pigeons flying like that it's all to the good replied mathews and then 
you handle your masses right i don't see anybody doing this sort of thing over 
here he meant in america for these two art workers considered themselves connoisseurs of pen 
and ink and illustration generally they were subscribers to jugend simplicissimus pickmeup and the radical 
european art journals they were aware of steinlen and cheret and mucha and the whole 
rising young school of french poster workers eugene was surprised to hear of these men 
and these papers he began to gain confidence in himselfto think of himself as somebody 
it was while he was gaining this knowledgefinding out who was who and what and 
why that he followed up his relationship with angela blue to its logical conclusionhe became 
engaged to her in spite of his connection with ruby kenny which continued unbroken after 
the dinner he nevertheless felt that he must have angela partly because she offered more 
resistance than any girl since stella and partly because she appeared to be so innocent 
simple and good hearted and she was altogether lovely she had a beautiful figure which 
no crudity of country dressmaking could conceal she had her wonderful wealth of hair and 
her large luring waterclear blue eyes she had colorful lips and cheeks a natural grace 
in walking could dance and play the piano eugene looked at her and came to 
the conclusion after a time that she was as beautiful as any girl he had 
ever seenthat she had more soul more emotion more sweetness he tried to hold her 
hand to kiss her to take her in his arms but she eluded him in 
a careful wary and yet half yielding way she wanted him to propose to her 
not because she was anxious to trap him but because her conventional conscience told her 
these things were not right outside a definite engagement and she wanted to be engaged 
first she was already in love with him when he pleaded she was anxious to 
throw herself in his arms in a mad embrace but she restrained herself waiting at 
last he flung his arms about her as she was sitting at the piano one 
evening and holding her tight pressed his lips to her cheek she struggled to her 
feet you musn't she said it isn't right i can't let you do that but 
i love you he exclaimed pursuing her i want to marry you will you have 
me angela will you be mine she looked at him yearningly for she realized that 
she had made him do things her waythis wild unpractical artistic soul she wanted to 
yield then and there but something told her to wait i won't tell you now 
she said i want to talk to papa and mamma i haven't told them anything 
as yet i want to ask them about you and then i'll tell you when 
i come again oh angela he pleaded now please wait mr witla she pleaded she 
had never yet called him eugene i'll come again in two or three weeks i 
want to think it over it's better he curbed his desire and waited but it 
made all the more vigorous and binding the illusion that she was the one woman 
in the world for him she aroused more than any woman yet a sense of 
the necessity of concealing the eagerness of his sensesof pretending something higher he even tried 
to deceive himself into the belief that this was a spiritual relationship but underneath all 
was a burning sense of her beauty her physical charm her passion she was sleeping 
as yet bound in convention and a semireligious interpretation of life if she were aroused 
he closed his eyes and dreamed chapter xiii in two weeks angela came back ready 
to plight her faith and eugene was waiting eager to receive it he had planned 
to meet her under the smoky train shed of the chicago milwaukee and st paul 
depot to escort her to kinsley's for dinner to bring her some flowers to give 
her a ring he had secured in anticipation a ring which had cost him seventyfive 
dollars and consumed quite all his savings but she was too regardful of the drama 
of the situation to meet him anywhere but in the parlor of her aunt's house 
where she could look as she wished she wrote that she must come down early 
and when he arrived at eight of a saturday evening she was dressed in the 
dress that seemed most romantic to her the one she had worn when she first 
met him at alexandria she half suspected that he would bring flowers and so wore 
none and when he came with pink roses she added those to her corsage she 
was a picture of rosy youth and trimness and not unlike the character by whose 
name he had christened herthe fair elaine of arthur's court her yellow hair was done 
in a great mass that hung sensuously about her neck her cheeks were rosy with 
the elation of the hour her lips moist her eyes bright she fairly sparkled her 
welcome as he entered at the sight of her eugene was beside himself he was 
always at the breaking point over any romantic situation the beauty of the ideathe beauty 
of love as love the delight of youth filled his mind as a song might 
made him tense feverish enthusiastic you're here at last angela he said trying to keep 
hold of her hands what word oh you musn't ask so soon she replied i 
want to talk to you first i'll play you something no he said following her 
as she backed toward the piano i want to know i must i can't wait 
i haven't made up my mind she pleaded evasively i want to think you had 
better let me play oh no he urged yes let me play she ignored him 
and swept into the composition but all the while she was conscious of him hovering 
over hera force at the close when she had been made even more emotionally responsive 
by the suggestion of the music he slipped his arms about her as he had 
once before but she struggled away again slipping to a corner and standing at bay 
he liked her flushed face her shaken hair the roses awry at her waist you 
must tell me now he said standing before her will you have me she dropped 
her head down as though doubting and fearing familiarities he slipped to one knee to 
see her eyes then looking up he caught her about the waist will you he 
asked she looked at his soft hair dark and thick his smooth pale brow his 
black eyes and even chin she wanted to yield dramatically and this was dramatic enough 
she put her hands to his head bent over and looked into his eyes her 
hair fell forward about her face will you be good to me she asked yearning 
into his eyes yes yes he declared you know that oh i love you so 
she put his head far back and laid her lips to his there was fire 
agony in it she held him so and then he stood up heaping kisses upon 
her cheeks her lips her eyes her neck good god he exclaimed how wonderful you 
are the expression shocked her you mustn't she said i can't help it you are 
so beautiful she forgave him for the compliment there were burning moments after this moments 
in which they clung to each other desperately moments in which he took her in 
his arms moments in which he whispered his dreams of the future he took the 
ring he had bought and put it on her finger he was going to be 
a great artist she was going to be an artist's bride he was going to 
paint her lovely face her hair her form if he wanted love scenes he would 
paint these which they were now living together they talked until one in the morning 
and then she begged him to go but he would not at two he left 
only to come early the next morning to take her to church there ensued for 
eugene a rather astonishing imaginative and emotional period in which he grew in perception of 
things literary and artistic and in dreams of what marriage with angela would mean to 
him there was a peculiar awareness about eugene at this time which was leading him 
into an understanding of things the extraordinary demands of some phases of dogma in the 
matter of religion the depths of human perversity in the matter of morality the fact 
that there were worlds within worlds of our social organism that really basically and actually 
there was no fixed and definite understanding of anything by anybody from mathews he learned 
of philosophieskant hegel schopenhauerfaint inklings of what they believed from association with howe he heard 
of current authors who expressed new moods pierre loti thomas hardy maeterlinck tolstoi eugene was 
no person to readhe was too eager to livebut he gained much by conversation and 
he liked to talk he began to think he could do almost anything if he 
triedwrite poems write plays write stories paint illustrate etc he used to conceive of himself 
as a general an orator a politicianthinking how wonderful he would be if he could 
set himself definitely to any one thing sometimes he would recite passages from great speeches 
he had composed in his imagination as he walked the saving grace in his whole 
makeup was that he really loved to work and he would work at the things 
he could do he would not shirk his assignments or dodge his duties after his 
evening class eugene would sometimes go out to ruby's house getting there by eleven and 
being admitted by an arrangement with her that the front door be left open so 
that he could enter quietly more than once he found her sleeping in her little 
room off the front room arrayed in a red silk dressing gown and curled up 
like a little blackhaired child she knew he liked her art instincts and she strove 
to gratify them affecting the peculiar and the exceptional she would place a candle under 
a red shade on a small table by her bed and pretend to have been 
reading the book being usually tossed to one side on the coverlet where he would 
see it lying when he came he would enter silently gathering her up in his 
arms as she dozed kissing her lips to waken her carrying her in his arms 
into the front room to caress her and whisper his passion there was no cessation 
of this devotion to ruby the while he was declaring his love for angela and 
he really did not see that the two interfered greatly he loved angela he thought 
he liked ruby thought she was sweet he felt sorry for her at times because 
she was such a little thing so unthinking who was going to marry her eventually 
what was going to become of her because of this very attitude he fascinated the 
girl who was soon ready to do anything for him she dreamed dreams of how 
nice it would be if they could live in just a little flat togetherall alone 
she would give up her art posing and just keep house for him he talked 
to her of thisimagining it might possibly come to passrealizing quite fully that it probably 
wouldn't he wanted angela for his wife but if he had money he thought ruby 
and he might keep a separate placesomehow what angela would think of this did not 
trouble himonly that she should not know he never breathed anything to either of the 
other but there were times when he wondered what they would think each of the 
other if they knew money money that was the great deterrent for lack of money 
he could not marry anybody at presentneither angela nor ruby nor anyone else his first 
duty he thought was so to place himself financially that he could talk seriously to 
any girl that was what angela expected of him he knew that was what he 
would have to have if he wanted ruby there came a time when the situation 
began to grow irksome he had reached the point where he began to understand how 
limited his life was mathews and howe who drew more money were able to live 
better than he they went out to midnight suppers theatre parties and expeditions to the 
tenderloin section not yet known by that name they had time to browse about the 
sections of the city which had peculiar charms for them as bohemians after darkthe levee 
as a certain section of the chicago river was called gambler's row in south clark 
street the whitechapel club as a certain organization of newspaper men was called and other 
places frequented by the literati and the more talented of the newspaper makers eugene first 
because of a temperament which was introspective and reflective and second because of his æsthetic 
taste which was offended by much that he thought was tawdry and cheap about these 
places and third by what he considered his lack of means took practically no part 
in these diversions while he worked in his class he heard of these thingsusually the 
next dayand they were amplified and made more showy and interesting by the narrative powers 
of the participants eugene hated coarse vulgar women and ribald conduct but he felt that 
he was not even permitted to see them at close range had he wanted to 
it took money to carouse and he did not have it perhaps because of his 
youth and a certain air of unsophistication and impracticability which went with him his employers 
were not inclined to consider money matters in connection with him they seemed to think 
he would work for little and would not mind he was allowed to drift here 
six months without a sign of increase though he really deserved more than any one 
of those who worked with him during the same period he was not the one 
to push his claims personally but he grew restless and slightly embittered under the strain 
and ached to be free though his work was as effective as ever it was 
this indifference on their part which fixed his determination to leave chicago although angela his 
art career his natural restlessness and growing judgment of what he might possibly become were 
deeper incentives angela haunted him as a dream of future peace if he could marry 
her and settle down he would be happy he felt now having fairly satiated himself 
in the direction of ruby that he might leave her she really would not care 
so very much her sentiments were not deep enough still he knew she would care 
and when he began going less regularly to her home really becoming indifferent to what 
she did in the artists' world he began also to feel ashamed of himself for 
he knew that it was a cruel thing to do he saw by her manner 
when he absented himself that she was hurt and that she knew he was growing 
cold are you coming out sunday night she asked him once wistfully i can't he 
apologized i have to work yes i know how you have to work but go 
on i don't mind i know oh ruby how you talk i can't always be 
here i know what it is eugene she replied you don't care any more oh 
well don't mind me now sweet don't talk like that he would say but after 
he was gone she would stand by her window and look out upon the shabby 
neighborhood and sigh sadly he was more to her than anyone she had met yet 
but she was not the kind that cried he is going to leave me was 
her one thought he is going to leave me goldfarb had watched eugene a long 
time was interested in him realized that he had talent he was leaving shortly to 
take a better sundayeditorship himself on a larger paper and he thought eugene was wasting 
his time and ought to be told so i think you ought to try to 
get on one of the bigger papers here witla he said to him one saturday 
afternoon when things were closing up you'll never amount to anything on this paper it 
isn't big enough you ought to get on one of the big ones why don't 
you try the tribuneor else go to new york i think you ought to do 
magazine work eugene drank it all in i've been thinking of that he said i 
think i'll go to new york i'll be better off there i would either do 
one or the other if you stay too long in a place like this it's 
apt to do you harm eugene went back to his desk with the thought of 
change ringing in his ears he would go he would save up his money until 
he had one hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars and then try his luck 
in the east he would leave ruby and angela the latter only temporarily the former 
for good very likely though he only vaguely confessed this to himself he would make 
some money and then he would come back and marry his dream from blackwood already 
his imaginative mind ran forward to a poetic wedding in a little country church with 
angela standing beside him in white then he would bring her back with him to 
new yorkhe eugene witla already famous in the east already the lure of the big 
eastern city was in his mind its palaces its wealth its fame it was the 
great world he knew this side of paris and london he would go to it 
now shortly what would he be there how great how soon so he dreamed chapter 
xiv once this idea of new york was fixed in his mind as a necessary 
step in his career it was no trouble for him to carry it out he 
had already put aside sixty dollars in a savings bank since he had given angela 
the ring and he decided to treble it as quickly as possible and then start 
he fancied that all he needed was just enough to live on for a little 
while until he could get a start if he could not sell drawings to the 
magazines he might get a place on a newspaper and anyhow he felt confident that 
he could live he communicated to howe and mathews his intention of going east pretty 
soon and aroused in their respective bosoms the emotions which were characteristic of each howe 
envious from the start was glad to have him off the paper but regretful of 
the stellar career which his determination foreboded he half suspected now that eugene would do 
something exceptionalhe was so loose in his moodsso eccentric mathews was glad for eugene and 
a little s wished he had eugene's courage his fire his talent you'll make good 
when you get down there mathews said to him one afternoon when howe was out 
of the room for he realized that the latter was jealous you've got the stuff 
some of the work you have done here will give you a fine introduction i 
wish i were going why don't you suggested eugene who me what good would it 
do me i'm not ready yet i can't do that sort of stuff i might 
go down some time i think you do good work said eugene generously he really 
did not believe it was good art but it was fair newspaper sketching oh no 
you don't mean that witla replied mathews i know what i can do eugene was 
silent i wish when you get down there went on mathews you would write us 
occasionally i would like to know how you are getting along sure i'll write replied 
eugene flattered by the interest his determination had aroused sure i will but he never 
did in ruby and angela he had two problems to adjust which were not so 
easy in the one case it was sympathy regret sorrow for her helplessness her hopelessness 
she was so sweet and lovely in her way but not quite big enough mentally 
or emotionally for him could he really live with her if he wanted to could 
he substitute her for a girl like angela could he and now he had involved 
angela for since her return to tell him that she accepted him as her affianced 
lover there had been some scenes between them in which a new standard of emotion 
had been set for him this girl who looked so simple and innocent was burning 
at times with a wild fire it snapped in her eyes when eugene undid her 
wonderful hair and ran his hands through its heavy strands the rhine maiden he would 
say little lorelei you are like the mermaid waiting to catch the young lover in 
the strands of her hair you are marguerite and i faust you are a dutch 
gretchen i love this wonderful hair when it is braided oh sweet you perfect creature 
i will put you in a painting yet i will make you famous angela thrilled 
to this she burned in a flame which was of his fanning she put her 
lips to his in long hot kisses sat on his knee and twined her hair 
about his neck rubbed his face with it as one might bathe a face in 
strands of silk finding such a response he went wild kissed her madly would have 
been still more masterful had she not at the slightest indication of his audacity leaped 
from his embrace not opposition but self protection in her eyes she pretended to think 
better of his love and eugene checked by her ideal of him tried to restrain 
himself he did manage to desist because he was sure that he could not do 
what he wanted to daring such as that would end her love so they wrestled 
in affection it was the fall following his betrothal to angela that he actually took 
his departure he had drifted through the summer pondering he had stayed away from ruby 
more and more and finally left without saying goodbye to her though he thought up 
to the last that he intended to go out and see her as for angela 
when it came to parting from her he was in a depressed and downcast mood 
he thought now that he did not really want to go to new york but 
was being drawn by fate there was no money for him in the west they 
could not live on what he could earn there hence he must go and in 
doing so must lose her it looked very tragic out at her aunt's house where 
she came for the saturday and sunday preceding his departure he walked the floor with 
her gloomily counted the lapse of the hours after which he would be with her 
no more pictured the day when he would return successful to fetch her angela had 
a faint foreboding fear of the events which might intervene she had read stories of 
artists who had gone to the city and had never come back eugene seemed such 
a wonderful person she might not hold him and yet he had given her his 
word and he was madly in love with herno doubt of that that fixed passionate 
yearning look in his eyeswhat did it mean if not enduring eternal love life had 
brought her a great treasurea great love and an artist for a lover go eugene 
she cried at last tragically almost melodramatically his face was in her hands i will 
wait for you you need never have one uneasy thought when you are ready i 
will be here only come soonyou will won't you will i he declared kissing her 
will i look at me don't you know yes yes yes she exclaimed of course 
i know oh yes yes the rest was a passionate embrace and then they parted 
he went out brooding over the subtlety and the tragedy of life the sharp october 
stars saddened him more it was a wonderful world but bitter to endure at times 
still it could be endured and there was happiness and peace in store for him 
probably he and angela would find it together living in each other's company living in 
each other's embrace and by each other's kisses it must be so the whole world 
believed iteven he after stella and margaret and ruby and angela even he the train 
which bore him to new york bore a very meditative young man as it pulled 
out through the great railroad yards of the city past the shabby back yards of 
the houses the street crossings at grade the great factories and elevators he thought of 
that other time when he had first ventured in the city how different then he 
was so green so raw since then he had become a newspaper artist he could 
write he could find his tongue with women he knew a little something about the 
organization of the world he had not saved any money true but he had gone 
through the art school had given angela a diamond ring had this two hundred dollars 
with which he was venturing to reconnoitre the great social metropolis of the country he 
was passing fiftyseventh street he recognized the neighborhood he traversed so often in visiting ruby 
he had not said goodbye to her and there in the distance were the rows 
of commonplace two family frame dwellings one of which she occupied with her foster parents 
poor little ruby and she liked him it was a shame but what was he 
to do about it he didn't care for her it really hurt him to think 
and then he tried not to remember these tragedies of the world could not be 
healed by thinking the train passed out into the flat fields of northern indiana and 
as little country towns flashed past he thought of alexandria and how he had pulled 
up his stakes and left it what was jonas lyle doing and john summers myrtle 
wrote that she was going to be married in the spring she had delayed solely 
because she wanted to delay he thought sometimes that myrtle was a little like himself 
fickle in her moods he was sure he would never want to go back to 
alexandria except for a short visit and yet the thought of his father and his 
mother and his old home were sweet to him his father how little he knew 
of the real world as they passed out of pittsburgh he saw for the first 
time the great mountains raising their heads in solemn majesty in the dark and great 
lines of coke ovens flaming red tongues of fire he saw men working and sleeping 
towns succeeding one another what a great country america was what a great thing to 
be an artist here millions of people and no vast artistic voice to portray these 
thingsthese simple dramatic things like the coke ovens in the night if he could only 
do it if he could only stir the whole country so that his name would 
be like that of doré in france or verestchagin in russia if he could but 
get fire into his work the fire he felt he got into his berth after 
a time and looked out on the dark night and the stars longing and then 
he dozed when he awoke again the train had already passed philadelphia it was morning 
and the cars were speeding across the flat meadows toward trenton he arose and dressed 
watching the array of towns the while trenton new brunswick metuchen elizabeth somehow this country 
was like illinois flat after newark they rushed out upon a great meadow and he 
caught the sense of the sea it was beyond this these were tidewater streams the 
passaic and the hackensack with small ships and coal and brick barges tied at the 
water side the thrill of something big overtook him as the brakeman began to call 
jersey city and as he stepped out into the vast train shed his heart misgave 
him a little he was all alone in new york it was wealthy cold and 
critical how should he prosper here he walked out through the gates to where low 
arches concealed ferry boats and in another moment it was before him sky line bay 
the hudson the statue of liberty ferry boats steamers liners all in a grey mist 
of fierce rain and the tugs and liners blowing mournfully upon great whistles it was 
something he could never have imagined without seeing it and this swish of real salt 
water rolling in heavy waves spoke to him as music might exalting his soul what 
a wonderful thing this was this seawhere ships were and whales and great mysteries what 
a wonderful thing new york was set down by it surrounded by it this metropolis 
of the country here was the sea yonder were the great docks that held the 
vessels that sailed to the ports of all the world he saw themgreat grey and 
black hulls tied to long piers jutting out into the water he listened to the 
whistles the swish of the water saw the circling gulls realized emotionally the mass of 
people here were jay gould and russell sage and the vanderbilts and morganall alive and 
all here wall street fifth avenue madison square broadwayhe knew of these by reputation how 
would he do herehow fare would the city ever acclaim him as it did some 
he looked wide eyed with an open heart with intense and immense appreciation well he 
was going to enter going to try he could do thatperhaps perhaps but he felt 
lonely he wished he were back with angela where her soft arms could shut him 
safe he wished he might feel her hands on his cheeks his hair he would 
not need to fight alone then but now he was alone and the city was 
roaring about him a great noise like the sea he must enter and do battle 
chapter xv not knowing routes or directions in new york eugene took a desbrosses street 
ferry and coming into west street wandered along that curious thoroughfare staring at the dock 
entrances manhattan island seemed a little shabby to him from this angle but he thought 
that although physically perhaps it might not be distinguished there must be other things which 
made it wonderful later when he saw the solidity of it the massed houses the 
persistent streams of people the crush of traffic it dawned on him that mere humanity 
in packed numbers makes a kind of greatness and this was the island's first characteristic 
there were others like the prevailing lowness of the buildings in its old neighborhoods the 
narrowness of the streets in certain areas the shabbiness of brick and stone when they 
have seen an hundred years of weather which struck him as curious or depressing he 
was easily touched by exterior conditions as he wandered he kept looking for some place 
where he might like to live some house that had a yard or a tree 
at length he found a row of houses in lower seventh avenue with an array 
of iron balconies in front which appealed to him he applied here and in one 
house found a room for four dollars which he thought he had better take for 
the present it was cheaper than any hotel his hostess was a shabby woman in 
black who made scarcely any impression on him as a personality merely giving him a 
thought as to what a dreary thing it was to keep roomers and the room 
itself was nothing a commonplace but he had a new world before him and all 
his interests were outside he wanted to see this city he deposited his grip and 
sent for his trunk and then took to the streets having come to see and 
hear things which would be of advantage to him he went about this early relationship 
to the city in the right spirit for a little while he did not try 
to think what he would do but struck out and walked here there and everywhere 
this very first day down broadway to the city hall and up broadway from th 
to nd street the same night soon he knew all third avenue and the bowery 
the wonders of fifth avenue and riverside drive the beauties of the east river the 
battery central park and the lower east side he sought out quickly the wonders of 
metropolitan lifeits crowds at dinner and theatre time in broadway its tremendous throngs morning and 
afternoon in the shopping district its amazing world of carriages in fifth avenue and central 
park he had marveled at wealth and luxury in chicago but here it took his 
breath away it was obviously so much more fixed so definite and comprehensible here one 
felt intuitively the far reaches which separate the ordinary man from the scion of wealth 
it curled him up like a frozen leaf dulled his very soul and gave him 
a clear sense of his position in the social scale he had come here with 
a pretty high estimate of himself but daily as he looked he felt himself crumbling 
what was he what was art what did the city care it was much more 
interested in other things in dressing eating visiting riding abroad the lower part of the 
island was filled with cold commercialism which frightened him in the upper half which concerned 
only women and showa voluptuous sybaritismcaused him envy he had but two hundred dollars with 
which to fight his way and this was the world he must conquer men of 
eugene's temperament are easily depressed he first gorged the spectacle of life and then suffered 
from mental indigestion he saw too much of it too quickly he wandered about for 
weeks looking in the shop windows the libraries the museums the great streets growing all 
the while more despondent at night he would return to his bare room and indite 
long epistles to angela describing what he had seen and telling her of his undying 
love for herlargely because he had no other means of ridding himself of his superabundant 
vitality and moods they were beautiful letters full of color and feeling but to angela 
they gave a false impression of emotion and sincerity because they appeared to be provoked 
by absence from her in part of course they were but far more largely they 
were the result of loneliness and the desire for expression which this vast spectacle of 
life itself incited he also sent her some tentative sketches of things he had seena 
large crowd in the dark at th street a boat off th street in the 
east river in the driving rain a barge with cars being towed by a tug 
he could not think exactly what to do with these things at that time but 
he wanted to try his hand at illustrating for the magazines he was a little 
afraid of these great publications however for now that he was on the ground with 
them his art did not appear so significant it was during the first few weeks 
that he received his only letter from ruby his parting letter to her written when 
he reached new york had been one of those makeshift affairs which faded passion indites 
he was so sorry he had to leave without seeing her he had intended to 
come out but the rush of preparation at the last moment and so forth he 
hoped to come back to chicago one of these days and he would look her 
up he still loved her but it was necessary for him to leaveto come where 
the greatest possibilities were i remember how sweet you were when i first saw you 
he added i shall never forget my first impressions little ruby it was cruel to 
add this touch of remembrance but the artist in him could not refrain it cut 
ruby as a double edged sword for she understood that he cared well enough that 
wayæsthetically it was not her but beauty that he loved and her particular beauty had 
lost its appeal she wrote after a time intending to be defiant indifferent but she 
really could not be she tried to think of something sharp to say but finally 
put down the simple truth dear eugene: she wrote i got your note several weeks 
ago but i could not bring myself to answer it before this i know everything 
is over between us and that is all right for i suppose it has to 
be you couldn't love any woman long i think i know what you say about 
your having to go to new york to broaden your field is true you ought 
to but i'm sorry you didn't come out you might have still i don't blame 
you eugene it isn't much different from what has been going on for some time 
i have cared but i'll get over that i know and i won't ever think 
hard of you won't you return me the notes i have sent you from time 
to time and my pictures you won't want them now ruby there was a little 
blank space on the paper and then: i stood by the window last night and 
looked out on the street the moon was shining and those dead trees were waving 
in the wind i saw the moon on that pool of water over in the 
field it looked like silver oh eugene i wish i were dead he jumped up 
as he read these words and clenched the letter in his hands the pathos of 
it all cut him to the quick raised his estimate of her made him feel 
as if he had made a mistake in leaving her he really cared for her 
after all she was sweet if she were here now he could live with her 
she might as well be a model in new york as in chicago he was 
on the verge of writing this when one of the long almost daily epistles angela 
was sending arrived and changed his mood he did not see how in the face 
of so great and clean a love as hers he could go on with ruby 
his affection had obviously been dying should he try to revive it now this conflict 
of emotions was so characteristic of eugene's nature that had he been soundly introspective he 
would have seen that he was an idealist by temperament in love with the æsthetic 
in love with love and that there was no permanent faith in him for anybodyexcept 
the impossible she as it was he wrote ruby a letter breathing regret and sorrow 
but not inviting her to come he could not have supported her long if she 
had he thought besides he was anxious to secure angela so that affair lapsed in 
the meantime he visited the magazine offices on leaving chicago he had put in the 
bottom of his trunk a number of drawings which he had done for the globehis 
sketches of the chicago river of blue island avenue of which he had once made 
a study as a street of goose island and of the lake front there were 
some street scenes too all forceful in the peculiar massing of their blacks the unexpected 
almost flashing use of a streak of white at times there was emotion in them 
a sense of life he should have been appreciated at once but oddly there was 
just enough of the radically strange about what he did to make his work seem 
crude almost coarse he drew a man's coat with a single dash of his pen 
he indicated a face by a spot if you looked close there was seldom any 
detail frequently none at all from the praise he had received at the art school 
and from mathews and goldfarb he was slowly coming to the conclusion that he had 
a way of his own being so individual he was inclined to stick to it 
he walked with an air of conviction which had nothing but his own belief in 
himself to back it up and it was not an air which drew anybody to 
him when he showed his pictures at the century harper's scribner's they were received with 
an air of weary consideration dozens of magnificent drawings were displayed on their walls signed 
by men whom eugene now knew to be leaders in the illustration world he returned 
to his room convinced that he had made no impression at all they must be 
familiar with artists a hundred times better than himself as a matter of fact eugene 
was simply overawed by the material face of things these men whose pictures he saw 
displayed on the walls of the art and editorial rooms of the magazines were really 
not in many instances any better than himself if as good they had the advantage 
of solid wood frames and artistic acceptance he was a long way as yet from 
magazine distinction but the work he did later had no more of the fire than 
had this early stuff it was a little broader in treatment a little less intolerant 
of detail but no more vigorous if as much so the various art directors were 
weary of smart young artists showing drawings a little suffering was good for them in 
the beginning so eugene was incontinently turned away with a little faint praise which was 
worse than opposition he sank very low in spirits there were still the smaller magazines 
and the newspapers however and he hunted about faithfully trying to get something to do 
from one or two of the smaller magazines he secured commissions after a time three 
or four drawings for thirtyfive dollars and from that had to be extracted models' fees 
he had to have a room where he could work as an artist receiving models 
to pose and he finally found one in west th street a back bedroom looking 
out over an open court and with a public stair which let all come who 
might without question this cost him twentyfive dollars a month but he thought he had 
better risk it if he could get a few commissions he could live chapter xvi 
the art world of new york is peculiar it was then and for some time 
after broken up into cliques with scarcely any unity there was a world of sculptors 
for instance in which some thirty or forty sculptors had partbut they knew each other 
slightly criticised each other severely and retired for the most part into a background of 
relatives and friends there was a painting world as distinguished from an illustrating world in 
which perhaps a thousand alleged artists perhaps more took part most of these were men 
and women who had some abilityenough to have their pictures hung at the national academy 
of design exhibitionto sell some pictures get some decorative work to do paint some portraits 
there were studio buildings scattered about various portions of the city in washington square in 
ninth and tenth streets in odd places such as macdougal alley and occasional cross streets 
from washington square to fiftyninth street which were filled with painters illustrators sculptors and craftsmen 
in art generally this painting world had more unity than the world of sculptors and 
in a way included the latter there were several art clubsthe salmagundi the kitkat and 
the lotusand there were a number of exhibitions ink water color oil with their reception 
nights where artists could meet and exchange the courtesies and friendship of their world in 
addition to this there were little communal groups such as those who resided in the 
tenth street studios the twentythird street y m c a the van dyck studios and 
so on it was possible to find little crowds now and then that harmonized well 
enough for a time and to get into a group if to use a colloquialism 
one belonged if you did not art life in new york might be a very 
dreary thing and one might go a long time without finding just the particular crowd 
with which to associate beside the painting world there was the illustrating world made up 
of beginners and those who had established themselves firmly in editorial favor these were not 
necessarily a part of the painting or sculpture worlds and yet in spirit were allied 
to them had their clubs also and their studios were in the various neighborhoods where 
the painters and sculptors were the only difference was that in the case of the 
embryo illustrators they were to be found living three or four in one studio partly 
because of the saving in expense but also because of the love of companionship and 
because they could hearten and correct one another in their work a number of such 
interesting groups were in existence when eugene arrived but of course he did not know 
of them it takes time for the beginner to get a hearing anywhere we all 
have to serve an apprenticeship whatever field we enter eugene had talent and determination but 
no experience no savoir faire no circle of friends and acquaintances the whole city was 
strange and cold and if he had not immediately fallen desperately in love with it 
as a spectacle he would have been unconscionably lonely and unhappy as it was the 
great fresh squares such as washington union and madison the great streets such as broadway 
fifth avenue and sixth avenue the great spectacles such as the bowery at night the 
east river the water front the battery all fascinated him with an unchanging glamor he 
was hypnotized by the wonder of this thingthe beauty of it such seething masses of 
people such whirlpools of life the great hotels the opera the theatres the restaurants all 
gripped him with a sense of beauty these lovely women in magnificent gowns these swarms 
of cabs with golden eyes like monstrous insects this ebb and surge of life at 
morning and evening made him forget his loneliness he had no money to spend no 
immediate hope of a successful career he could walk these streets look in these windows 
admire these beautiful women thrill at the daily newspaper announcements of almost hourly successes in 
one field or another here and there in the news an author had made a 
great success with a book a scientist with a discovery a philosopher with a new 
theory a financier with an investment there was news of great plays being put on 
great actors and actresses coming from abroad great successes being made by débutantes in society 
great movements forwarded generally youth and ambition had the callhe saw that it was only 
a question of time if you had talent when you would get your hearing he 
longed ardently for his but he had no feeling that it was coming to him 
quickly so he got the blues it was a long road to travel one of 
his pet diversions these days and nights was to walk the streets in rain or 
fog or snow the city appealed to him wet or white particularly the public squares 
he saw fifth avenue once in a driving snowstorm and under sputtering arc lights and 
he hurried to his easel next morning to see if he could not put it 
down in black and white it was unsuccessful or at least he felt so for 
after an hour of trying he threw it aside in disgust but these spectacles were 
drawing him he was wanting to do themwanting to see them shown somewhere in color 
possible success was a solace at a time when all he could pay for a 
meal was fifteen cents and he had no place to go and not a soul 
with whom to talk it was an interesting phase of eugene's character that he had 
a passion for financial independence he might have written home from chicago at times when 
he was hard pressed he might have borrowed some money from his father now but 
preferred to earn itto appear to be further along than he was if anyone had 
asked him he would have said he was doing fine practically he so wrote to 
angela giving as an excuse for further delay that he wanted to wait until he 
had ample means he was trying all this time to make his two hundred dollars 
go as far as possible and to add to it by any little commissions he 
could get however small he figured his expenses down to ten dollars a week and 
managed to stay within that sum the particular building in which he had settled was 
really not a studio building but an old rundown boarding and apartment house turned partially 
to uses of trade the top floor contained three fair sized rooms and two hall 
bedrooms all occupied by lonely individuals plying some craft or other eugene's next door neighbor 
chanced to be a hack illustrator who had had his training in boston and had 
set up his easel here in the hope of making a living there were not 
many exchanges of courtesies between them at first although the door being open the second 
day he arrived he saw that an artist worked there for the easel was visible 
no models applying at first he decided to appeal to the art students' league he 
called on the secretary and was given the names of four who replied to postal 
cards from him one he selected a young swedish american girl who looked somewhat like 
the character in the story he had in mind she was neat and attractive with 
dark hair a straight nose and pointed chin and eugene immediately conceived a liking for 
her he was ashamed of his surroundings however and consequently diffident this particular model was 
properly distant and he finished his pictures with as much expedition and as little expense 
as he possibly could eugene was not given to scraping odd acquaintances though he made 
friends fast enough when the balance of intellect was right in chicago he had become 
friendly with several young artists as a result of working with them at the institute 
but here he knew no one having come without introductions he did become acquainted with 
his neighbor philip shotmeyer he wanted to find out about local art life from him 
but shotmeyer was not brilliant and could not supply him with more than minor details 
of what eugene desired to know through him he learnt a little of studio regions 
art personalities the fact that young beginners worked in groups shotmeyer had been in such 
a group the year before though why he was alone now he did not say 
he sold drawings to some of the minor magazines better magazines than eugene had yet 
had dealings with one thing he did at once for eugene which was very helpful: 
he admired his work he saw as had others before him something of his peculiar 
distinction as an artist attended every show and one day he gave him a suggestion 
which was the beginning of eugene's successful magazine career eugene was working on one of 
his street scenesa task which he invariably essayed when he had nothing else to do 
shotmeyer had drifted in and was following the strokes of his brush as he attempted 
to portray a mass of east side working girls flooding the streets after six o'clock 
there were dark walls of buildings a flaring gas lamp or two some yellow lighted 
shop windows and many shaded half seen facesbare suggestions of souls and pulsing life say 
said shotmeyer at one point that kind o' looks like the real thing to me 
i've seen a crowd like that have you replied eugene you ought to be able 
to get some magazine to use that as a frontispiece why don't you try truth 
with that truth was a weekly which eugene along with many others in the west 
had admired greatly because it ran a double page color insert every week and occasionally 
used scenes of this character somehow he always needed a shove of this kind to 
make him act when he was drifting he put more enthusiasm into his work because 
of shotmeyer's remark and when it was done decided to carry it to the office 
of truth the art director approved it on sight though he said nothing but carried 
it in to the editor here's a thing that i consider a find in its 
way he set it proudly upon the editorial desk say said the editor laying down 
a manuscript that's the real thing isn't it who did that a young fellow by 
the name of witla who has just blown in here he looks like the real 
thing to me say went on the editor look at the suggestion of faces back 
there what reminds me just a little of the masses in doré stuffit's good isn't 
it it's fine echoed the art director i think he's a comer if nothing happens 
to him we ought to get a few centre pages out of him how much 
does he want for this oh he doesn't know he'll take almost anything i'll give 
him seventyfive dollars that's all right said the editor as the art director took the 
drawing down there's something new there you ought to hang on to him i will 
replied his associate he's young yet he doesn't want to be encouraged too much he 
went out pulling a solemn countenance i like this fairly well he said we may 
be able to find room for it i'll send you a check shortly if you'll 
let me have your address eugene gave it his heart was beating a gay tattoo 
in his chest he did not think anything of price in fact it did not 
occur to him all that was in his mind was the picture as a double 
page spread so he had really sold one after all and to truth now he 
could honestly say he had made some progress now he could write angela and tell 
her he could send her copies when it came out he could really have something 
to point to after this and best of all now he knew he could do 
street scenes he went out into the street treading not the grey stone pavement but 
air he threw back his head and breathed deep he thought of other scenes like 
this which he could do his dreams were beginning to be realizedhe eugene witla the 
painter of a double page spread in truth already he was doing a whole series 
in his imagination all he had ever dreamed of he wanted to run and tell 
shotmeyerto buy him a good meal he almost loved him commonplace hack that he wasbecause 
he had suggested to him the right thing to do say shotmeyer he said sticking 
his head in that worthy's door you and i eat tonight truth took that drawing 
isn't that fine said his floormate without a trace of envy well i'm glad i 
thought they'd like it eugene could have cried poor shotmeyer he wasn't a good artist 
but he had a good heart he would never forget him chapter xvii this one 
significant sale with its subsequent check of seventyfive dollars and later the appearance of the 
picture in color gave eugene such a lift in spirit that he felt for the 
time being as though his art career had reached a substantial basis and he began 
to think of going to blackwood to visit angela but first he must do some 
more work he concentrated his attention on several additional scenes doing a view of greeley 
square in a sopping drizzle and a picture of an l train speeding up the 
bowery on its high thin trestle of steel he had an eye for contrasts picking 
out lights and shadows sharply making wonderful blurs that were like colors in precious stones 
confused and suggestive he took one of these after a month to truth and again 
the art director was his victim he tried to be indifferent but it was hard 
the young man had something that he wanted you might show me anything else you 
do in this line he said i can use a few if they come up 
to these two eugene went away with his head in the air he was beginning 
to get the courage of his ability it takes quite a number of drawings at 
seventyfive and one hundred dollars each to make a living income and artists were too 
numerous to make anyone's opportunity for immediate distinction easy eugene waited months to see his 
first drawing come out he stayed away from the smaller magazines in the hope that 
he would soon be able to contribute to the larger ones but they were not 
eagerly seeking new artists he met through shotmeyer two artists who were living in one 
studio in waverly place and took a great liking to them one of them mchugh 
was an importation from wyoming with delicious stories of mountain farming and mining the other 
smite was a fisher lad from nova scotia mchugh tall and lean with a face 
that looked like that of a raw yokel but with some gleam of humor and 
insight in the eyes which redeemed it instantly was eugene's first choice of a pleasing 
genial personality joseph smite had a sense of the sea about him he was short 
and stout and rather solidly put together like a blacksmith he had big hands and 
feet a big mouth big bony eye sockets and coarse brown hair when he talked 
ordinarily it was with a slow halting air and when he smiled or laughed it 
was with his whole face when he became excited or gay something seemed to happen 
distinctly to every part of his body his face became a curious crosshatch of genial 
lines his tongue loosened and he talked fast he had a habit of emphasizing his 
language with oaths on these occasionsnumerous and picturesque for he had worked with seafaring men 
and had accumulated a vast vocabulary of picturesque expressions they were vacant of evil intent 
so far as he was concerned for there was no subtlety or guile in him 
he was kindly and genial all through eugene wanted to be friendly and struck a 
gay relationship with these two he found that he got along excellently well with them 
and could swap humorous incidents and character touches by the hour it was some months 
before he could actually say that he was intimate with them but he began to 
visit them regularly and after a time they called on him it was during this 
year that he came to know several models passingly well to visit the various art 
exhibitions to be taken up by hudson dula the art director of truth and invited 
to two or three small dinners given to artists and girls he did not find 
anyone he liked exceptionally well barring one editor of a rather hopeless magazine called craft 
devoted to art subjects a young blond of poetic temperament who saw in him a 
spirit of beauty and tried to make friends with him eugene responded cheerfully and thereafter 
richard wheeler was a visitor at his studio from time to time he was not 
making enough to house himself much better these days but he did manage to buy 
a few plaster casts and to pick up a few nice things in copper and 
brass for his studio his own drawings his street scenes were hung here and there 
the way in which the exceptionally clever looked at them convinced him by degrees that 
he had something big to say it was while he was settling himself in this 
atmospherethe spring of the second yearthat he decided to go back and visit angela and 
incidentally alexandria and chicago he had been away now sixteen months had not seen anyone 
who had won his affections or alienated him from his love of angela he wrote 
in march that he thought he would be coming in may or june he did 
get away in julya season when the city was suffering from a wave of intense 
heat he had not done so muchillustrated eight or ten stories and drawn four double 
page pictures for truth one of which had appeared but he was getting along just 
as he was starting for chicago and blackwood a second one was put on the 
newsstand and he proudly carried a copy of it with him on the train it 
was the bowery by night with the l train rushing overhead and as reproduced it 
had color and life he felt intensely proud and knew that angela would also she 
had written him such a glowing appreciation of the east side picture called six o'clock 
as he rode he dreamed he reached it at last the long stretch between new 
york and chicago traversed he arrived in the lake city in the afternoon and without 
pausing to revisit the scenes of his earlier efforts took a five o'clock train for 
blackwood it was sultry and on the way heavy thunder clouds gathered and broke in 
a short splendid summer rain the trees and grass were thoroughly wet and the dust 
of the roads was laid there was a refreshing coolness about the air which caressed 
the weary flesh little towns nestling among green trees came into view and passed again 
and at last blackwood appeared it was smaller than alexandria but not so different like 
the other it was marked by a church steeple a saw mill a pretty brick 
business street and many broad branching green trees eugene felt drawn to it at sight 
it was such a place as angela should live in it was seven o'clock and 
nearing dusk when he arrived he had not given angela the definite hour of his 
arrival and so decided to stay over night at the little inn or socalled hotel 
which he saw up the street he had brought only a large suit case and 
a traveling bag he inquired of the proprietor the direction and distance of the blue 
house from the town found that he could get a vehicle any time in the 
morning which would take him over as the phrase ran for a dollar he ate 
his supper of fried steak and poor coffee and fried potatoes and then sat out 
on the front porch facing the street in a rocking chair to see how the 
village of blackwood wagged and to enjoy the cool of the evening as he sat 
he thought of angela's home and how nice it must be this town was such 
a little placeso quiet there would not be another train coming up from the city 
until after eleven after a time he rose and took a short walk breathing the 
night air later he came back and throwing wide the windows of the stuffy room 
sat looking out the summer night with its early rain its wet trees its smell 
of lush wet growing things was impressing itself on eugene as one might impress wet 
clay with a notable design eugene's mood was soft toward the little houses with their 
glowing windows the occasional pedestrians with their howdy jakes and evenin' henrys he was touched 
by the noise of the crickets the chirp of the tree toads the hang of 
the lucent suns and planets above the tree tops the whole night was quick with 
the richness of fertility stirring subtly about some work which concerned man very little or 
not at all yet of which he was at least a part till his eyelids 
drooped after a time and he went to bed to sleep deeply and dreamlessly next 
morning he was up early eager for the hour to arrive when he might start 
he did not think it advisable to leave before nine o'clock and attracted considerable attention 
by strolling about his tall spare graceful figure and forceful profile being an unusual sight 
to the natives at nine o'clock a respectable carryall was placed at his disposal and 
he was driven out over a long yellow road damp with the rain of the 
night before and shaded in places by overhanging trees there were so many lovely wild 
flowers growing in the angles of the rail fenceswild yellow and pink roses elder flower 
queen anne's lace dozens of beautiful blooms that eugene was lost in admiration his heart 
sang over the beauty of yellowing wheatfields the young corn already three feet high the 
vistas of hay and clover with patches of woods enclosing them and over all house 
martens and swallows scudding after insects and high up in the air his boyhood dream 
of beauty a soaring buzzard as he rode the moods of his boyhood days came 
back to himhis love of winging butterflies and birds his passion for the voice of 
the wooddove there was one crying in the still distance nowhis adoration for the virile 
strength of the men of the countryside he thought as he rode that he would 
like to paint a series of country scenes that would be as simple as those 
cottage dooryards that they now and then passed this little stream that cut the road 
at right angles and made a drinking place for the horses this skeleton of an 
old abandoned home doorless and windowless where the roof sagged and hollyhocks and morning glories 
grew high under the eaves we city dwellers do not know he sighed as though 
he had not taken the country in his heart and carried it to town as 
had every other boy and girl who had gone the way of the metropolis the 
blue homestead was located in the centre of a rather wide rolling stretch of country 
which lay between two gently rising ridges of hill covered with trees one corner of 
the farm and that not so very far from the house was cut by a 
stream a little shallow thing singing over pebbles and making willows and hazel bushes to 
grow in profusion along its banks and there was a little lake within a mile 
of the house in front of it was a ten acre field of wheat to 
the right of it a grazing patch of several acres to the left a field 
of clover and near the house by a barn a well a pig pen a 
corn crib and some smaller sheds in front of the house was a long open 
lawn down the centre of which ran a gravel path lined on either side by 
tall old elm trees the immediate dooryard was shut from this noble lawn by a 
low picket fence along the length of which grew lilac bushes and inside which nearer 
the house were simple beds of roses calycanthus and golden glow over an arbor leading 
from the backdoor to a rather distant summer kitchen flourished a grapevine and there was 
a tall remnant of a tree trunk covered completely with a yellow blooming trumpet vine 
the dooryard's lawn was smooth enough and the great lawn was a dream of green 
grass graced with the shadows of a few great trees the house was long and 
of no great depth the front a series of six rooms ranged in a row 
without an upper storey the two middle rooms which had originally perhaps seventy years before 
been all there was of the house since then all the other rooms had been 
added and there was in addition to these a leanto containing a winter kitchen and 
dining room and to the west of the arbor leading to the summer kitchen an 
old unpainted frame storehouse in all its parts the place was shabby and run down 
but picturesque and quaint eugene was surprised to find the place so charming it appealed 
to him the long low front with doors opening from the centre and end rooms 
direct upon the grass with windows set in climbing vines and the lilac bushes forming 
a green wall between the house and the main lawn the great rows of elm 
trees throwing a grateful shade seemed like sentinel files as the carryall turned in at 
the wagon gate in front he thought what a place for love and to think 
angela should live here the carryall rattled down the pebble road to the left of 
the lawn and stopped at the garden gate marietta came out marietta was twentytwo years 
old and as gay and joyous as her elder sister angela was sober and in 
a way morbid light souled as a kitten looking always on the bright side of 
things she made hosts of friends everywhere she went having a perfect swarm of lovers 
who wrote her eager notes but whom she rebuffed with good natured sympathetic simplicity here 
on this farm there was not supposed to be so much opportunity for social life 
as in town but beaux made their way here on one pretext and another marietta 
was the magnet and in the world of gaiety which she created angela shared angela 
was now in the dining roomeasy to be calledbut marietta wanted to see for herself 
what sort of lover her sister had captured she was surprised at his height his 
presence the keenness of his eyes she hardly understood so fine a lover for her 
own sister but held out her hand smilingly this is mr witla isn't it she 
asked the same he replied a little pompously isn't it a lovely drive over here 
we think it nice in nice weather she laughed you wouldn't like it so much 
in winter won't you come in and put your grip here in the hall david 
will take it to your room eugene obeyed but he was thinking of angela and 
when she would appear and how she would look he stepped into the large low 
ceiled dark cool parlor and was delighted to see a piano and some music piled 
on a rack through an open window he saw several hammocks out on the main 
lawn under the trees it seemed a wonderful place to him the substance of poetryand 
then angela appeared she was dressed in plain white linen her hair braided as he 
liked it in a great rope lay as a band across her forehead she had 
picked a big pink rose and put it in her waist at sight of her 
eugene held out his arms and she flew to them he kissed her vigorously for 
marietta had discreetly retired and they were left alone so i have you at last 
he whispered and kissed her again oh yes yes and it has been so long 
she sighed you couldn't have suffered any more than i have he consoled every minute 
has been torture waiting waiting waiting let's not think of that now she urged we 
have each other you are here yes here i am he laughed all the virtues 
done up in one brown suit isn't it lovelythese great trees that beautiful lawn he 
paused from kissing to look out of the window i'm glad you like it she 
replied joyously we think it's nice but this place is so old i love it 
for that he cried appreciatively those bushes are so nicethose roses oh dear you don't 
know how sweet it all seemsand youyou are so nice he held her off at 
arm's length and surveyed her while she blushed becomingly his eager direct vigorous onslaught confused 
her at timescaused her pulse to beat at a high rate they went out into 
the dooryard after a time and then marietta appeared again and with her mrs blue 
a comfortable round bodied mother of sixty who greeted eugene cordially he could feel in 
her what he felt in his own motherin every good motherlove of order and peace 
love of the well being of her children love of public respect and private honor 
and morality all these things eugene heartily respected in others he was glad to see 
them believed they had a place in society but was uncertain whether they bore any 
fixed or important relationship to him he was always thinking in his private conscience that 
life was somehow bigger and subtler and darker than any given theory or order of 
living it might well be worth while for a man or woman to be honest 
and moral within a given condition or quality of society but it did not matter 
at all in the ultimate substance and composition of the universe any form or order 
of society which hoped to endure must have individuals like mrs blue who would conform 
to the highest standards and theories of that society and when found they were admirable 
but they meant nothing in the shifting subtle forces of nature they were just accidental 
harmonies blossoming out of something which meant everything here to this order nothing to the 
universe at large at twentytwo years of age he was thinking these things wondering whether 
it would be possible ever to express them wondering what people would think of him 
if they actually knew what he did think wondering if there was anything anything which 
was really stablea rock to cling toand not mere shifting shadow and unreality mrs blue 
looked at her daughter's young lover with a kindly eye she had heard a great 
deal about him having raised her children to be honest moral and truthful she trusted 
them to associate only with those who were equally so she assumed that eugene was 
such a man and his frank open countenance and smiling eyes and mouth convinced her 
that he was basically good also what to her were his wonderful drawings sent to 
angela in the form of proofs from time to time particularly the one of the 
east side crowd had been enough to prejudice her in his favor no other daughter 
of the family and there were three married had approximated to this type of man 
in her choice eugene was looked upon as a prospective soninlaw who would fulfill all 
the conventional obligations joyfully and as a matter of course it's very good of you 
to put me up mrs blue eugene said pleasantly i've always wanted to come out 
here for a visiti've heard so much of the family from angela it's just a 
country home we have not much to look at but we like it replied his 
hostess she smiled blandly asked if he wouldn't make himself comfortable in one of the 
hammocks wanted to know how he was getting along with his work in new york 
and then returned to her cooking for she was already preparing his first meal eugene 
strolled with angela to the big lawn under the trees and sat down he was 
experiencing the loftiest of human emotions on earthlove in youth accepted and requited hope in 
youth justified in action by his success in new york peace in youth for he 
had a well earned holiday in his grasp was resting with the means to do 
so and with love and beauty and admiration and joyous summer weather to comfort him 
as he rocked to and fro in the hammock gazing at the charming lawn and 
realizing all these things his glance rested at last upon angela and he thought life 
can really hold no finer thing than this chapter xviii toward noon old jotham blue 
came in from a cornfield where he had been turning the earth between the rows 
although sixtyfive and with snowy hair and beard he looked to be vigorous and good 
to live until ninety or a hundred his eyes were blue and keen his color 
rosy he had great broad shoulders set upon a spare waist for he had been 
a handsome figure of a man in his youth how do you do mr witla 
he inquired with easy grace as he strolled up the yellow mud of the fields 
on his boots he had pulled a big jackknife out of his pocket and begun 
whittling a fine twig he had picked up i'm glad to see you my daughter 
angela has been telling me one thing and another about you he smiled as he 
looked at eugene angela who was sitting beside him rose and strolled toward the house 
i'm glad to see you said eugene i like your country around here it looks 
prosperous it is prosperous said the old patriarch drawing up a chair which stood at 
the foot of a tree and seating himself eugene sank back into the hammock it's 
a soil that's rich in lime and carbon and sodiumthe things which make plant life 
grow we need very little fertilizer herevery little the principal thing is to keep the 
ground thoroughly cultivated and to keep out the bugs and weeds he cut at his 
stick meditatively eugene noted the chemical and physical knowledge relative to farming it pleased him 
to find brain coupled with crop cultivation i noticed some splendid fields of wheat as 
i came over he observed yes wheat does well here blue went on when the 
weather is moderately favorable corn does well we have a splendid apple crop and grapes 
are generally successful in this state i have always thought that wisconsin had a little 
the best of the other valley states for we are blessed with a moderate climate 
plenty of streams and rivers and a fine broken landscape there are good mines up 
north and lots of lumber we are a prosperous people we wisconsiners decidedly prosperous this 
state has a great future eugene noted the wide space between his clear blue eyes 
as he talked he liked the bigness of his conception of his state and of 
his country no petty little groundharnessed ploughman this but a farmer in the big sense 
of the worda cultivator of the soil with an understanding of itan american who loved 
his state and his country i have always thought of the mississippi valley as the 
country of the future said eugene we have had the valley of the nile and 
the valley of the euphrates with big populations but this is something larger i rather 
feel as though a great wave of population were coming here in the future it 
is the new paradise of the world said jotham blue pausing in his whittling and 
holding up his right hand for emphasis we haven't come to realize its possibilities the 
fruit the corn the wheat to feed the nations of the world can be raised 
here i sometimes marvel at the productivity of the soil it is so generous it 
is like a great mother it only asks to be treated kindly to give all 
that it has eugene smiled the bigness of his prospective fatherinlaw's feelings lured him he 
felt as though he could love this man they talked on about other things the 
character of the surrounding population the growth of chicago the recent threat of a war 
with venezuela the rise of a new leader in the democratic party a man whom 
jotham admired very much as he was telling of the latter's exploitsit appeared he had 
recently met him at blackwoodmrs blue appeared in the front door jotham she called he 
rose my wife must want a bucket of water he said and strolled away eugene 
smiled this was lovely this was the way life should becompounded of health strength good 
nature understanding simplicity he wished he were a man like jotham as sound as hearty 
as clean and strong to think he had raised eight children no wonder angela was 
lovely they all were no doubt while he was rocking marietta came back smiling her 
blond hair blowing about her face like her father she had blue eyes like him 
a sanguine temperament warm and ruddy eugene felt drawn to her she reminded him a 
little of rubya little of margaret she was bursting with young health you're stronger than 
angela he said looking at her oh yes i can always outrun angelface she exclaimed 
we fight sometimes but i can get things away from her she has to give 
in sometimes i feel olderi always take the lead eugene rejoiced in the sobriquet of 
angelface it suited angela he thought she looked like pictures of angels in the old 
prints and in the stained glass windows he had seen he wondered in a vague 
way however whether marietta did not have the sweeter temperamentwere not really more lovable and 
cosy but he put the thought forcefully out of his mind he felt he must 
be loyal to angela here while they were talking the youngest boy david came up 
and sat down on the grass he was short and stocky for his yearssixteenwith an 
intelligent face and an inquiring eye eugene noted stability and quiet force in his character 
at once he began to see that these children had inherited character as well as 
strength from their parents this was a home in which successful children were being reared 
benjamin came up after awhile a tall overgrown puritanical youth with western modifications and then 
samuel the oldest of the living boys and the most impressive he was big and 
serene like his father of brown complexion and hickory strength eugene learned in the conversation 
that he was a railroad man in st paulhome for a brief vacation after three 
years of absence he was with a road called the great northern already a second 
assistant passenger agent and with great prospects so the family thought eugene could see that 
all the boys and girls like angela were ruggedly and honestly truthful they were written 
all over with christian preceptnot church dogmabut christian precept lightly and good naturedly applied they 
obeyed the ten commandments in so far as possible and lived within the limits of 
what people considered sane and decent eugene wondered at this his own moral laxity was 
a puzzle to him he wondered whether he were not really all wrong and they 
all right yet the subtlety of the universe was always with himthe mystery of its 
chemistry for a given order of society no doubt he was out of placefor life 
in general well he could not say at dinner was announced from the door by 
mrs blue and they all rose it was one of those simple home feasts common 
to any intelligent farming family there was a generous supply of fresh vegetables green peas 
new potatoes new string beans a steak had been secured from the itinerant butcher who 
served these parts and mrs blue had made hot light biscuit eugene expressed a predilection 
for fresh buttermilk and they brought him a pitcherful saying that as a rule it 
was given to the pigs the children did not care for it they talked and 
jested and he heard odd bits of information concerning people here and theresome farmer who 
had lost a horse by colic some other farmer who was preparing to cut his 
wheat there were frequent references to the three oldest sisters who lived in other wisconsin 
towns their children appeared to be numerous and fairly troublesome they all came home frequently 
it appeared and were bound up closely with the interests of the family as a 
whole the more you know about the blue family observed samuel to eugene who expressed 
surprise at the solidarity of interest the more you realize that they're a clan not 
a family they stick together like glue that's a rather nice trait i should say 
laughed eugene who felt no such keen interest in his relatives well if you want 
to find out how the blue family stick together just do something to one of 
them observed jake doll a neighbor who had entered that's sure true isn't it sis 
observed samuel who was sitting next to angela putting his hand affectionately on his sister's 
arm eugene noted the movement she nodded her head affectionately yes we blues all hang 
together eugene almost begrudged him his sister's apparent affection could such a girl be cut 
out of such an atmosphereseparated from it completely brought into a radically different world he 
wondered would she understand him would he stick by her he smiled at jotham and 
mrs blue and thought he ought to but life was strange you never could tell 
what might happen during the afternoon there were more lovely impressions he and angela sat 
alone in the cool parlor for two hours after dinner while he restated his impressions 
of her over and over he told her how charming he thought her home was 
how nice her father and mother what interesting brothers she had he made a genial 
sketch of jotham as he had strolled up to him at noon which pleased angela 
and she kept it to show to her father he made her pose in the 
window and sketched her head and her halo of hair he thought of his double 
page illustration of the bowery by night and went to fetch it looking for the 
first time at the sweet cool room at the end of the house which he 
was to occupy one window a west one had hollyhocks looking in and the door 
to the north gave out on the cool shady grass he moved in beauty he 
thought was treading on showered happiness it hurt him to think that such joy might 
not always be as though beauty were not everywhere and forever present when angela saw 
the picture which truth had reproduced she was beside herself with joy and pride and 
happiness it was such a testimony to her lover's ability he had written almost daily 
of the new york art world so she was familiar with that in exaggerated ideas 
but these actual things like reproduced pictures were different the whole world would see this 
picture he must be famous already she imagined that evening and the next and the 
next as they sat in the parlor alone he drew nearer and nearer to that 
definite understanding which comes between a man and woman when they love eugene could never 
stop with mere kissing and caressing in a reserved way if not persistently restrained it 
seemed natural to him that love should go on he had not been married he 
did not know what its responsibilities were he had never given a thought to what 
his parents had endured to make him worth while there was no instinct in him 
to tell him he had no yearnings for parenthood that normal desire which gives visions 
of a home and the proper social conditions for rearing a family all he thought 
of was the love making periodthe billing and cooing and the transports of delight which 
come with it with angela he felt that these would be supernormal precisely because she 
was so slow in yieldingso on the defensive against herself he could look in her 
eyes at times and see a swooning veil which foreshadowed a storm of emotion he 
would sit by her stroking her hands touching her cheek smoothing her hair or at 
other times holding her in his arms it was hard for her to resist those 
significant pressures he gave to hold him at arm's length for she herself was eager 
for the delights of love it was on the third night of his stay and 
in the face of his growing respect for every member of this family that he 
swept angela to the danger linewould have carried her across it had it not been 
for a fortuitous wave of emotion which was not of his creation but of hers 
they had been to the little lake okoonee a little way from the house during 
the afternoon for a swim afterward he and angela and david and marietta had taken 
a drive it was one of those lovely afternoons that come sometimes in summer and 
speak direct to the heart of love and beauty it was so fair and warm 
the shadows of the trees so comforting that they fairly made eugene's heart ache he 
was young now life was beautiful but how would it be when he was old 
a morbid anticipation of disaster seemed to harrow his soul the sunset had already died 
away when they drew near home insects hummed a cowbell tinkled now and then breaths 
of cool air those harbingers of the approaching eve swept their cheeks as they passed 
occasional hollows approaching the house they saw the blue smoke curls rising from the kitchen 
chimney foretelling the preparation of the evening meal eugene clasped angela's hand in an ecstasy 
of emotion he wanted to dreamsitting in the hammock with angela as the dusk fell 
watching the pretty scene life was all around jotham and benjamin came in from the 
fields and the sound of their voices and of the splashing water came from the 
kitchen door where they were washing there was an anticipatory stamping of horses' feet in 
the barn the lowing of a distant cow the hungry grunt of pigs eugene shook 
his headit was so pastoral so sweet at supper he scarcely touched what was put 
before him the group at the dining table holding his attention as a spectacle afterwards 
he sat with the family on the lawn outside the door breathing the odor of 
flowers watching the stars over the trees listening to jotham and mrs blue to samuel 
benjamin david marietta and occasionally angela because of his mood sad in the face of 
exquisite beauty she also was subdued she said little listening to eugene and her father 
but when she did talk her voice was sweet jotham arose after a time and 
went to bed and one by one the others followed david and marietta went into 
the sitting room and then samuel and benjamin left they gave as an excuse hard 
work for the morning samuel was going to try his hand again at thrashing eugene 
took angela by the hand and led her out where some hydrangeas were blooming white 
as snow by day but pale and silvery in the dark he took her face 
in his hands telling her again of love it's been such a wonderful day i'm 
all wrought up he said life is so beautiful here this place is so sweet 
and peaceful and you oh you kisses ended his words they stood there a little 
while then went back into the parlor where she lighted a lamp it cast a 
soft yellow glow over the room just enough to make it warm he thought they 
sat first side by side on two rocking chairs and then later on a settee 
he holding her in his arms before supper she had changed to a loose cream 
colored house gown now eugene persuaded her to let her hair hang in the two 
braids real passion is silent it was so intense with him that he sat contemplating 
her as if in a spell she leaned back against his shoulder stroking his hair 
but finally ceased even that for her own feeling was too intense to make movement 
possible she thought of him as a young god strong virile beautifula brilliant future before 
him all these years she had waited for someone to truly love her and now 
this splendid youth had apparently cast himself at her feet he stroked her hands her 
neck cheeks then slowly gathered her close and buried his head against her bosom angela 
was strong in convention in the precepts of her parents in the sense of her 
family and its attitude but this situation was more than she could resist she accepted 
first the pressure of his arm then the slow subtlety with which he caressed her 
resistance seemed almost impossible now for he held her closetight within the range of his 
magnetism when finally she felt the pressure of his hand upon her quivering limbs she 
threw herself back in a transport of agony and delight no no eugene she begged 
no no save me from myself save me from myself oh eugene he paused a 
moment to look at her face it was wrought in lines of intense sufferingpale as 
though she were ill her body was quite limp only the hot moist lips told 
the significant story he could not stop at once slowly he drew his hand away 
then let his sensitive artists' fingers rest gently on her neckher bosom she struggled lamely 
at this point and slipped to her knees her dress loosened at the neck don't 
eugene she begged don't think of my father my mother i who have boasted so 
i of whom they feel so sure oh eugene i beg of you he stroked 
her hair her cheeks looking into her face as abélard might have looked at héloïse 
oh i know why it is she exclaimed convulsively i am no better than any 
other but i have waited so long so long but i mustn't oh eugene i 
mustn't help me vaguely eugene understood she had been without lovers why he thought she 
was beautiful he got up half intending to carry her to his room but he 
paused thinking she was such a pathetic figure was he really as bad as this 
could he not be fair in this one instance her father had been so nice 
to himher motherhe saw jotham blue before him mrs blue her admiring brothers and sisters 
as they had been a little while before he looked at her and still the 
prize lured himalmost swept him on in spite of himself but he stayed stand up 
angela he said at last pulling himself together looking at her intensely she did so 
leave me now he went on right away i won't answer for myself if you 
don't i am really trying please go she paused looking at him fearfully regretfully oh 
forgive me eugene she pleaded forgive me he said i'm the one but you go 
now sweet you don't know how hard this is help me by going she moved 
away and he followed her with his eyes yearningly burningly until she reached the door 
when she closed it softly he went into his own room and sat down his 
body was limp and weary he ached from head to foot from the intensity of 
the mood he had passed through he went over the recent incidents almost stunned by 
his experience and then went outside and stood under the stairs listening tree toads were 
chirping there were suspicious cracklings in the grass as of bugs stirring a duck quacked 
somewhere feebly the bell of the family cow tinkled somewhere over near the water of 
the little stream he saw the great dipper in the sky sirius canopus the vast 
galaxy of the milky way what is life anyway he asked himself what is the 
human body what produces passion here we are for a few years surging with a 
fever of longing and then we burn out and die he thought of some lines 
he might write of pictures he might paint all the while reproduced before his mind's 
eye like a cinematograph were views of angela as she had been tonight in his 
arms on her knees he had seen her true form he had held her in 
his arms he had voluntarily resigned her charms for tonight anyhow no harm had come 
it never should chapter xix it would be hard to say in what respect if 
any the experiences of this particular night altered eugene's opinion of angela he was inclined 
to like her better for what he would have called her humanness thus frankly to 
confess her weakness and inability to save herself was splendid that he was given the 
chance to do a noble deed was fortunate and uplifting he knew now that he 
could take her if he wished but once calm again he resolved to be fair 
and not to insist he could wait the state of angela's mind on the contrary 
once she had come out of her paroxysm and gained the privacy of her own 
room or rather the room she shared with marietta at the other extreme of the 
house was pitiable she had for so long considered herself an estimable and virtuous girl 
there was in her just a faint trace of prudery which might readily have led 
to an unhappy old maid existence for her if eugene with his superiority or nonunderstanding 
or indifference to conventional theories and to oldmaidish feelings had not come along and with 
his customary blindness to material prosperity and age limitations seized upon and made love to 
her he had filled her brain with a whirlwind of notions hitherto unfamiliar to her 
world and set himself up in her brain as a law unto himself he was 
not like other menshe could see that he was superior to them he might not 
make much money being an artist but he could make other things which to her 
seemed more desirable fame beautiful pictures notable friends were not these things far superior to 
money she had had little enough money in all conscience and if eugene made anything 
at all it would be enough for her he seemed to be under the notion 
that he needed a lot to get married whereas she would have been glad to 
risk it on almost anything at all this latest revelation of herself besides tearing her 
mind from a carefully nurtured belief in her own virtuous impregnability raised at the same 
time a spectre of disaster in so far as eugene's love for her was concerned 
would he now that she had allowed him those precious endearments which should have been 
reserved for the marriage bed only care for her as much as he had before 
would he not think of her as a light minded easily spoiled creature who was 
waiting only for a propitious moment to yield herself she had been lost to all 
sense of right and wrong in that hour that she knew her father's character and 
what he stood for her mother's decency and love of virtue her cleanlyminded rightliving brothers 
and sistersall had been forgotten and here she was a tainted maiden virtuous in technical 
sense it is true but tainted her conventiontrained conscience smote her vigorously and she groaned 
in her heart she went outside the door of her own room and sat down 
on the damp grass in the early morning to think it was so cool and 
calm everywhere but in her own soul she held her face in her hands feeling 
her hot cheeks wondering what eugene was thinking now what would her father think her 
mother she wrung her hands more than once and finally went inside to see if 
she could not rest she was not unconscious of the beauty and joy of the 
episode but she was troubled by what she felt she ought to think what the 
consequences to her future might be to hold eugene nowthat was a subtle question to 
hold up her head in front of him as she had could she to keep 
him from going further it was a difficult situation and she tossed restlessly all night 
getting little sleep in the morning she arose weary and disturbed but more desperately in 
love than ever this wonderful youth had revealed an entirely new and intensely dramatic world 
to her when they met on the lawn again before breakfast angela was garbed in 
white linen she looked waxen and delicate and her eyes showed dark rings as well 
as the dark thoughts that were troubling her eugene took her hand sympathetically don't worry 
he said i know it isn't as bad as you think and he smiled tenderly 
oh eugene i don't understand myself now she said sorrowfully i thought i was better 
than that we're none of us better than that he replied simply we just think 
we are sometimes you are not any different to me you just think you are 
oh are you sure she asked eagerly quite sure he replied love isn't a terrible 
thing between any two it's just lovely why should i think worse of you oh 
because good girls don't do what i have done i have been raised to know 
betterto do better all a belief my dear which you get from what has been 
taught you you think it wrong why because your father and mother told you so 
isn't that it oh not that alone everybody thinks it's wrong the bible teaches that 
it is everybody turns his back on you when he finds out wait a minute 
pleaded eugene argumentatively he was trying to solve this puzzle for himself let's leave the 
bible out of it for i don't believe in the biblenot as a law of 
action anyhow the fact that everybody thinks it's wrong wouldn't necessarily make it so would 
it he was ignoring completely the significance of everybody as a reflection of those principles 
which govern the universe nooo ventured angela doubtfully listen went on eugene everybody in constantinople 
believes that mahomet is the prophet of god that doesn't make him so does it 
no well then everyone here might believe that what we did last night was wrong 
without making it so isn't that true yes replied angela confusedly she really did not 
know she could not argue with him he was too subtle but her innate principles 
and instincts were speaking plainly enough nevertheless now what you're really thinking about is what 
people will do they'll turn their backs on you you say that is a practical 
matter your father might turn you out of doors i think he would replied angela 
little understanding the bigness of the heart of her father i think he wouldn't said 
eugene but that's neither here nor there men might refuse to marry you those are 
material considerations you wouldn't say they had anything to do with real right or wrong 
would you eugene had no convincing end to his argument he did not know any 
more than anyone else what was right or wrong in this matter he was merely 
talking to convince himself but he had enough logic to confuse angela i don't know 
she said vaguely right he went on loftily is something which is supposed to be 
in accordance with a standard of truth now no one in all the world knows 
what truth is no one there is no way of telling you can only act 
wisely or unwisely as regards your personal welfare if that's what you're worrying about and 
it is i can tell you that you're no worse off there's nothing the matter 
with your welfare i think you're better off for i like you better angela wondered 
at the subtlety of his brain she was not sure but that what he said 
might be true could her fears be baseless she felt sure she had lost some 
of the bloom of her youth anyhow how can you she asked referring to his 
saying that he liked her better easily enough he replied i know more about you 
i admire your frankness you're lovelyaltogether so you are sweet beyond compare he started to 
particularize don't eugene she pleaded putting her finger over her lips the color was leaving 
her cheeks please don't i can't stand it all right he said i won't but 
you're altogether lovely let's go and sit in the hammock no i'm going to get 
you your breakfast it's time you had something he took comfort in his privileges for 
the others had all gone jotham samuel benjamin and david were in the fields mrs 
blue was sewing and marietta had gone to see a girl friend up the road 
angela as ruby before her bestirred herself about the youth's meal mixing biscuit broiling him 
some bacon cleaning a basket of fresh dewberries for him i like your man said 
her mother coming out where she was working he looks to be goodnatured but don't 
spoil him if you begin wrong you'll be sorry you spoiled papa didn't you asked 
angela sagely recalling all the little humorings her father had received your father has a 
keen sense of duty retorted her mother it didn't hurt him to be spoiled a 
little maybe eugene has replied her daughter turning her slices of bacon her mother smiled 
all her daughters had married well perhaps angela was doing the best of all certainly 
her lover was the most distinguished yet well to be careful she suggested angela thought 
if her mother only knew or her father dear heaven and yet eugene was altogether 
lovely she wanted to wait on him to spoil him she wished she could be 
with him every day from now onthat they need not part any more oh if 
he would only marry me she sighed it was the one divine event which would 
complete her life eugene would have liked to linger in this atmosphere indefinitely old jotham 
he found liked to talk to him he took an interest in national and international 
affairs was aware of distinguished and peculiar personalities seemed to follow world currents everywhere eugene 
began to think of him as a distinguished personality in himself but old jotham waved 
the suggestion blandly aside i'm a farmer he said i've seen my greatest success in 
raising good children my boys will do well i know for the first time eugene 
caught the sense of fatherhood of what it means to live again in your children 
but only vaguely he was too young too eager for a varied life too lustful 
so its true import was lost for the time sunday came and with it the 
necessity to leave he had been here nine days really two days more than he 
had intended to stay it was farewell to angela who had come so close so 
much in his grasp that she was like a child in his hands it was 
farewell moreover to an ideal scene a bit of bucolic poetry when would he see 
again an old patriarch like jotham clean kindly intelligent standing upright amid his rows of 
corn proud to be a good father not ashamed to be poor not afraid to 
be old or to die eugene had drawn so much from him it was like 
sitting at the feet of isaiah it was farewell to the lovely fields and the 
blue hills the long rows of trees down the lawn walk the white and red 
and blue flowers about the dooryard he had slept so sweetly in his clean room 
he had listened so joyously to the voices of birds the wood dove and the 
poet thrush he had heard the water in the blue's branch rippling over its clean 
pebbles the pigs in the barnyard pen the horses the cows all had appealed to 
him he thought of gray's elegyof goldsmith's deserted village and the traveller this was something 
like the things those men had loved he walked down the lawn with angela when 
the time came repeating how sorry he was to go david had hitched up a 
little brown mare and was waiting at the extreme end of the lawn oh sweet 
he sighed i shall never be happy until i have you i will wait sighed 
angela although she was wishing to exclaim: oh take me take me when he was 
gone she went about her duties mechanically for it was as if all the fire 
and joy had gone out of her life without this brilliant imagination of his to 
illuminate things life seemed dull and he rode parting in his mind with each lovely 
thing as he wentthe fields of wheat the little stream lake okoonee the pretty blue 
farmhouse all he said to himself: nothing more lovely will ever come again angela in 
my arms in her simple little parlor dear god and there are only seventy years 
of lifenot more than ten or fifteen of true youth all told chapter xx eugene 
carried home with him not only a curiously deepened feeling for angela due to their 
altered and more intimate relationship but moreover a growing respect for her family old jotham 
was so impressive a figure of a man his wife so kindly and earnest their 
attitude toward their children and to each other was so sound and their whole relationship 
to society so respectable another observer might have been repelled by the narrowness and frugality 
of their lives but eugene had not known enough of luxury to be scornful of 
the material simplicity of such existence here he had found character poetry of location poetry 
of ambition youth and happy prospects these boys so sturdy and independent were sure to 
make for themselves such places in the world as they desired marietta so charming a 
girl could not but make a good marriage samuel was doing well in his position 
with the railroad company benjamin was studying to be a lawyer and david was to 
be sent to west point he liked them for their familiar sterling worth and they 
all treated him as the destined husband of angela by the end of his stay 
he had become as much en rapport with the family as if he had known 
it all his life before going back to new york he had stopped in chicago 
where he had seen howe and mathews grinding away at their old tasks and then 
for a few days in alexandria where he found his father busy about his old 
affairs sewing machines were still being delivered by him in person and the long roads 
of the country were as briskly traversed by his light machinecarrying buggy as in his 
earliest days eugene saw him now as just a little futile and yet he admired 
him his patience his industry the brisk sewing machine agent was considerably impressed by his 
son's success and was actually trying to take an interest in art one evening coming 
home from the post office he pointed out a street scene in alexandria as a 
subject for a painting eugene knew that art had only been called to his father's 
attention by his own efforts he had noticed these things all his life no doubt 
but attached no significance to them until he had seen his son's work in the 
magazines if you ever paint country things you ought to paint cook's mill over here 
by the falls that's one of the prettiest things i know anywhere he said to 
him one evening trying to make his son feel the interest he took eugene knew 
the place it was attractive a little branch of bright water running at the base 
of a forty foot wall of red sandstone and finally tumbling down a fifteen foot 
declivity of grey mossy stones it was close to a yellow road which carried a 
good deal of traffic and was surrounded by a company of trees which ornamented it 
and sheltered it on all sides eugene had admired it in his youth as beautiful 
and peaceful it is nice he replied to his father i'll take a look at 
it some day witla senior felt set up his son was doing him honor mrs 
witla like her husband was showing the first notable traces of the flight of time 
the crow'sfeet at the sides of her eyes were deeper the wrinkles in her forehead 
longer at the sight of eugene the first night she fairly thrilled for he was 
so well developed now so selfreliant he had come through his experiences to a kind 
of poise which she realized was manhood her boy requiring her careful guidance was gone 
this was someone who could guide her tease her as a man would a child 
you've got so big i hardly know you she said as he folded her in 
his arms no you're just getting little ma i used to think i'd never get 
to the point where you couldn't shake me but that's all over isn't it you 
never did need much shaking she said fondly myrtle who had married frank bangs the 
preceding year had gone with her husband to live in ottumwa iowa where he had 
taken charge of a mill so eugene did not see her but he spent some 
little time with sylvia now the mother of two children her husband was the same 
quiet conservative plodder eugene had first noted him to be revisiting the office of the 
appeal he found that john summers had recently died otherwise things were as they had 
been jonas lyle and caleb williams were still in chargequite the same as before eugene 
was glad when his time was up and took the train back to chicago with 
a light heart again as on his entrance to chicago from the east and on 
his return to it from blackwood he was touched keenly by the remembrance of ruby 
she had been so sweet to him his opening art experiences had in a way 
been centred about her but in spite of all he did not want to go 
out and see her or did he he asked himself this question with a pang 
of sorrow for in a way he cared he cared for her as one might 
care for a girl in a play or book she had the quality of a 
tragedy about her sheher life her surroundings her misfortune in loving him constituted an artistic 
composition he thought he might be able to write a poem about it some time 
he was able to write rather charming verse which he kept to himself he had 
the knack of saying things in a simple way and with feelingmaking you see a 
picture the trouble with his verse was that it lacked as yet any real nobility 
of thoughtwas not as final in understanding as it might have been he did not 
go to see ruby the reason he assigned to himself was that it would not 
be nice she might not want him to now she might be trying to forget 
and he had angela it really wasn't fair to her but he looked over toward 
the region in which she lived as he travelled out of the city eastward and 
wished that some of those lovely moments he had spent with her might be lived 
again back in new york life seemed to promise a repetition of the preceding year 
with some minor modifications in the fall eugene went to live with mchugh and smite 
the studio they had consisting of one big working room and three bedrooms they agreed 
that they could get along together and for a while it was good for them 
all the criticism they furnished each other was of real value and they found it 
pleasant to dine together to walk to see the exhibitions they stimulated each other with 
argument each having a special point of view it was much as it had been 
with howe and mathews in chicago during this winter eugene made his first appearance in 
one of the leading publications of the timeharper's magazine he had gone to the art 
director with some proofs of his previous work and had been told that it was 
admirable if some suitable story turned up he would be considered later a letter came 
asking him to call and a commission involving three pictures for was given him he 
worked them out successfully with models and was complimented on the result his associates cheered 
him on also for they really admired what he was doing he set out definitely 
to make scribner's and the century as getting into those publications was called and after 
a time he succeeded in making an impression on their respective art directors though no 
notable commissions were given him from one he secured a poem rather out of his 
mood to decorate and from the other a short story but somehow he could not 
feel that either was a real opportunity he wanted an appropriate subject or to sell 
them some of his scenes building up a paying reputation was slow work although he 
was being mentioned here and there among artists his name was anything but a significant 
factor with the public or with the art directors he was still a promising beginnergrowing 
but not yet arrived by a long distance there was one editor who was inclined 
to see him at his real worth but had no money to offer this was 
richard wheeler editor of craft a rather hopeless magazine in a commercial sense but devoted 
sincerely enough to art wheeler was a blond young man of poetic temperament whose enthusiasm 
for eugene's work made it easy for them to become friends it was through wheeler 
that he met that winter miriam finch and christina channing two women of radically different 
temperaments and professions who opened for eugene two entirely new worlds miriam finch was a 
sculptor by professiona critic by temperament with no great capacity for emotion in herself but 
an intense appreciation of its significance in others to see her was to be immediately 
impressed with a vital force in womanhood she was a woman who had never had 
a real youth or a real love affair but clung to her ideal of both 
with a passionate almost fatuous faith that they could still be brought to pass wheeler 
had invited him to go round to her studio with him one evening he was 
interested to know what eugene would think of her miriam already thirtytwo when eugene met 
hera tiny brown haired brown eyed girl with a slender rather catlike figure and a 
suavity of address and manner which was artistic to the finger tips she had none 
of that budding beauty that is the glory of eighteen but she was altogether artistic 
and delightful her hair encircled her head in a fluffy cloudy mass her eyes moved 
quickly with intense intelligence feeling humor sympathy her lips were sweetly modelled after the pattern 
of a cupid's bow and her smile was subtly ingratiating her sallow complexion matched her 
brown hair and the drab velvet or corduroy of her dress there was a striking 
simplicity about the things she wore which gave her a distinctive air her clothes were 
seldom fashionable but always exceedingly becoming for she saw herself as a whole and arrayed 
herself as a decorative composition from head to foot with a sense of fitness in 
regard to self and life to such a nature as eugene's an intelligent artistic selfregulating 
and selfpoised human being was always intensely magnetic and gratifying he turned to the capable 
person as naturally as a flower turns toward the light finding a joy in contemplating 
the completeness and sufficiency of such a being to have ideas of your own seemed 
to him a marvellous thing to be able definitely to formulate your thoughts and reach 
positive and satisfying conclusions was a great and beautiful thing from such personalities eugene drank 
admiringly until his thirst was satiatedthen he would turn away if his thirst for what 
they had to give returned he might come backnot otherwise hitherto all his relationships with 
personages of this quality had been confined to the male sex for he had not 
known any women of distinction beginning with temple boyle instructor in the life class in 
chicago and vincent beers instructor in the illustration class he had encountered successively jerry mathews 
mitchell goldfarb peter mchugh david smite and jotham blue all men of intense personal feeling 
and convictions and men who had impressed him greatly now he was to encounter for 
the first time some forceful really exceptional women of the same calibre stella appleton margaret 
duff ruby kenny and angela blue were charming girls in their way but they did 
not think for themselves they were not organized selfdirected selfcontrolled personalities in the way that 
miriam finch was she would have recognized herself at once as being infinitely superior intellectually 
and artistically to any or all of them while entertaining at the same time a 
sympathetic appreciative understanding of their beauty fitness equality of value in the social scheme she 
was a student of life a critic of emotions and understanding with keen appreciative intelligence 
and yet longing intensely for just what stella and margaret and ruby and even angela 
hadyouth beauty interest for men the power or magnetism or charm of face and form 
to compel the impetuous passion of a lover she wanted to be loved by someone 
who could love madly and beautifully and this had never come to her miss finch's 
home or rather studio was with her family in east twentysixth street where she occupied 
a north room on the third floor but her presence in the bosom of that 
family did not prevent her from attaining an individuality and an exclusiveness which was most 
illuminating to eugene her room was done in silver brown and grey with a great 
waxfestooned candlestick fully five feet high standing in one corner and a magnificent carved chest 
of early flemish workmanship standing in another there was a brown combination writing desk and 
bookshelf which was arrayed with some of the most curious volumespater's marius the epicurean daudet's 
wives of men of genius richard jefferies' story of my heart stevenson's aes triplex the 
kasidah of richard burton the house of life by dante gabriel rossetti also sprach zarathustra 
by friedrich nietzsche the fact that they were here after he had taken one look 
at the woman and the room was to eugene sufficient proof that they were important 
he handled them curiously reading odd paragraphs nosing about looking at pictures and making rapid 
notes in his mental notebook this was someone worth knowing he felt that he wanted 
to make a sufficiently favorable impression to be permitted to know her better miriam finch 
was at once taken with eugene there was such an air of vigor inquiry appreciation 
and understanding about him that she could not help being impressed he seemed somewhat like 
a lighted lamp casting a soft shaded velvety glow he went about her room after 
his introduction looking at her pictures her bronzes and clays asking after the creator of 
this the painter of that where a third thing came from i never heard of 
one of these books he said frankly when he looked over the small specially selected 
collection there are some very interesting things here she volunteered coming to his side his 
simple confession appealed to her he was like a breath of fresh air richard wheeler 
who had brought him in made no objection to being neglected he wanted her to 
enjoy his find you know said eugene looking up from burton's kasidah and into her 
brown eyes new york gets me dizzy it's so wonderful just how she asked it's 
so compact of wonderful things i saw a shop the other day full of old 
jewelry and ornaments and quaint stones and clothes and o heaven i don't know what 
allmore things than i had ever seen in my whole life before and here in 
this quiet side street and this unpretentious house i find this room nothing seems to 
show on the outside everything seems crowded to suffocation with luxury or art value on 
the inside are you talking about this room she ventured why yes he replied take 
note mr wheeler she called over her shoulder to her young editor friend this is 
the first time in my life that i have been accused of possessing luxury when 
you write me up again i want you to give me credit for luxury i 
like it i'll certainly do it said wheeler yes 'art values' too yes 'art values' 
i have it said wheeler eugene smiled he liked her vivacity i know what you 
mean she added i've felt the same thing about paris you go into little unpretentious 
places there and come across such wonderful thingsheaps and heaps of fine clothes antiques jewels 
where was it i read such an interesting article about that not in craft i 
hope ventured wheeler no i don't think so harper's bazaar i believe oh pshaw exclaimed 
wheeler harper's bazaar what rot but that's just what you ought to have why don't 
you do itright i will he said eugene went to the piano and turned over 
a pile of music again he came across the unfamiliar the strange the obviously distinguishedgrieg's 
arabian dance es war ein traum by lassen elegie by massenet otidi by davydoff nymphs 
and shepherds by purcellthings whose very titles smacked of color and beauty gluck sgambati rossini 
tschaikowskythe italian scarlattieugene marvelled at what he did not know about music play something he 
pleaded and with a smile miriam stepped to the piano do you know 'es war 
ein traum' she inquired no said he that's lovely put in wheeler sing it eugene 
had thought that possibly she sang but he was not prepared for the burst of 
color that came with her voice it was not a great voice but sweet and 
sympathetic equal to the tasks she set herself she selected her music as she selected 
her clothesto suit her capacity the poetic sympathetic reminiscence of the song struck home eugene 
was delighted oh he exclaimed bringing his chair close to the piano and looking into 
her face you sing beautifully she gave him a glittering smile now i'll sing anything 
you want for you if you go on like that i'm crazy about music he 
said i don't know anything about it but i like this sort of thing you 
like the really good things i know so do i he felt flattered and grateful 
they went through otidi the nightingale elegie the last springmusic eugene had never heard before 
but he knew at once that he was listening to playing which represented a better 
intelligence a keener selective judgment a finer artistic impulse than anyone he had ever known 
had possessed ruby played and angela the latter rather well but neither had ever heard 
of these things he was sure ruby had only liked popular things angela the standard 
melodiesbeautiful but familiar here was someone who ignored popular tastewas in advance of it in 
all her music he had found nothing he knew it grew on him as a 
significant fact he wanted to be nice to her to have her like him so 
he drew close and smiled and she always smiled back like the others she liked 
his face his mouth his eyes his hair he's charming she thought when he eventually 
left and his impression of her was of a woman who was notably and significantly 
distinguished chapter xxi but miriam finch's family of which she seemed so independent had not 
been without its influence on her this family was of middle west origin and did 
not understand or sympathize very much with the artistic temperament since her sixteenth year when 
miriam had first begun to exhibit a definite striving toward the artistic her parents had 
guarded her jealously against what they considered the corrupting atmosphere of the art world her 
mother had accompanied her from ohio to new york and lived with her while she 
studied art in the art school chaperoning her everywhere when it became advisable as she 
thought for miriam to go abroad she went with her miriam's artistic career was to 
be properly supervised when she lived in the latin quarter in paris her mother was 
with her when she loitered in the atmosphere of the galleries and palaces in rome 
it was with her mother at her side at pompeii and herculaneumin london and in 
berlinher mother an ironwilled little woman at fortyfive at that time was with her she 
was convinced that she knew exactly what was good for her daughter and had more 
or less made the girl accept her theories later miriam's personal judgment began to diverge 
slightly from that of her mother and then trouble began it was vague at first 
hardly a definite tangible thing in the daughter's mind but later it grew to be 
a definite feeling that her life was being cramped she had been warned off from 
association with this person and that had been shown the pitfalls that surround the free 
untrammelled life of the art studio marriage with the average artist was not to be 
considered modelling from the nude particularly the nude of a man was to her mother 
at first most distressing she insisted on being present and for a long time her 
daughter thought that was all right finally the presence the viewpoint the intellectual insistence of 
her mother became too irksome and an open break followed it was one of those 
family tragedies which almost kill conservative parents mrs finch's heart was practically broken the trouble 
with this break was that it came a little too late for miriam's happiness in 
the stress of this insistent chaperonage she had lost her youththe period during which she 
felt she should have had her natural freedom she had lost the interest of several 
men who in her nineteenth twentieth and twentyfirst years had approached her longingly but who 
could not stand the criticism of her mother at twentyeight when the break came the 
most delightful love period was over and she felt grieved and resentful at that time 
she had insisted on a complete and radical change for herself she had managed to 
get through one art dealer and another orders for some of her spirited clay figurines 
there was a dancing girl a visualization of one of the moods of carmencita a 
celebrated dancer of the period which had caught the public fancyat least the particular art 
dealer who was handling her work for her had managed to sell some eighteen replicas 
of it at each miss finch's share of this was each there was another little 
thing a sixinch bronze called sleep which had sold some twenty replicas at each and 
was still selling the wind a figure crouching and huddling as if from cold was 
also selling it looked as though she might be able to make from three to 
four thousand dollars a year steadily she demanded of her mother at this time the 
right to a private studio to go and come when she pleased to go about 
alone wherever she wished to have men and women come to her private apartment and 
be entertained by her in her own manner she objected to supervision in any form 
cast aside criticism and declared roundly that she would lead her own life she realized 
sadly while she was doing it however that the best was gonethat she had not 
had the wit or the stamina to do as she pleased at the time she 
most wanted to do so now she would be almost automatically conservative she could not 
help it eugene when he first met her felt something of this he felt the 
subtlety of her temperament her philosophic conclusions what might be called her emotional disappointment she 
was eager for life which seemed to him odd for she appeared to have so 
much by degrees he got it out of her for they came to be quite 
friendly and then he understood clearly just how things were by the end of three 
months and before christina channing appeared eugene had come to the sanest cleanest understanding with 
miss finch that he had yet reached with any woman he had dropped into the 
habit of calling there once and sometimes twice a week he had learned to understand 
her point of view which was detachedly æsthetic and rather removed from the world of 
the sensuous her ideal of a lover had been fixed to a certain extent by 
statues and poems of greek youthhylas adonis perseus and by those men of the middle 
ages painted by millais burnejones dante gabriel rossetti and ford madox brown she had hoped 
for a youth with a classic outline of face distinction of form graciousness of demeanor 
and an appreciative intellect he must be manly but artistic it was a rather high 
ideal not readily capable of attainment by a woman already turned thirty but nevertheless worth 
dreaming about although she had surrounded herself with talented youth as much as possibleboth young 
men and young womenshe had not come across the one there had been a number 
of times when for a very little while she had imagined she had found him 
but had been compelled to see her fancies fail all the youths she knew had 
been inclined to fall in love with girls younger than themselvessome to the interesting maidens 
she had introduced them to it is hard to witness an ideal turning from yourself 
its spiritual counterpart and fixing itself upon some mere fleshly vision of beauty which a 
few years will cause to fade such had been her fate however and she was 
at times inclined to despair when eugene appeared she had almost concluded that love was 
not for her and she did not flatter herself that he would fall in love 
with her nevertheless she could not help but be interested in him and look at 
times with a longing eye at his interesting face and figure it was so obvious 
that if he loved at all it would be dramatically in all probability beautifully as 
time went on she took pains to be agreeable to him he had as it 
were the freedom of her room she knew of exhibitions personalities movementsin religion art science 
government literature she was inclined to take an interest in socialism and believed in righting 
the wrongs of the people eugene thought he did but he was so keenly interested 
in life as a spectacle that he hadn't as much time to sympathize as he 
thought he ought to have she took him to see exhibitions and to meet people 
being rather proud of a boy with so much talent and she was pleased to 
find that he was so generally acceptable people particularly writers poets musiciansbeginners in every field 
were inclined to remember him he was an easy talker witty quick to make himself 
at home and perfectly natural he tried to be accurate in his judgments of things 
and fair but he was young and subject to strong prejudices he appreciated her friendship 
and did not seek to make their relationship more intimate he knew that only a 
sincere proposal of marriage could have won her and he did not care enough for 
her for that he felt himself bound to angela and curiously he felt miriam's age 
as a bar between them he admired her tremendously and was learning in part through 
her what his ideal ought to be but he was not drawn sufficiently to want 
to make love to her but in christina channing whom he met shortly afterward he 
found a woman of a more sensuous and lovable type though hardly less artistic christina 
channing was a singer by profession living also in new york with her mother but 
not as miss finch had been dominated by her so thoroughly although she was still 
at the age when her mother could and did have considerable influence with her she 
was twentyseven years of age and so far had not yet attained the eminence which 
subsequently was hers though she was full of that buoyant selfconfidence which makes for eventual 
triumph so far she had studied ardently under various teachers had had several love affairs 
none serious enough to win her away from her chosen profession and had gone through 
the various experiences of those who begin ignorantly to do something in art and eventually 
reach experience and understanding of how the world is organized and what they will have 
to do to succeed although miss channing's artistic sense did not rise to that definite 
artistic expression in her material surroundings which characterized miss finch's studio atmosphere it went much 
farther in its expression of her joy in life her voice a rich contralto deep 
full colorful had a note of pathos and poignancy which gave a touch of emotion 
to her gayest songs she could play well enough to accompany herself with delicacy and 
emphasis she was at present one of the soloists with the new york symphony orchestra 
with the privilege of accepting occasional outside engagements the following fall she was preparing to 
make a final dash to germany to see if she could not get an engagement 
with a notable court opera company and so pave the way for a new york 
success she was already quite well known in musical circles as a promising operatic candidate 
and her eventual arrival would be not so much a question of talent as of 
luck while these two women fascinated eugene for the time being his feeling for angela 
continued unchanged for though she suffered in an intellectual or artistic comparison he felt that 
she was richer emotionally there was a poignancy in her love letters an intensity about 
her personal feelings when in his presence which moved him in spite of himselfan ache 
went with her which brought a memory of the tales of sappho and marguerite gautier 
it occurred to him now that if he flung her aside it might go seriously 
with her he did not actually think of doing anything of the sort but he 
was realizing that there was a difference between her and intellectual women like miriam finch 
besides that there was a whole constellation of society women swimming into his kenwomen whom 
he only knew as yet through the newspapers and the smart weeklies like town topics 
and vogue who were presenting still a third order of perfection vaguely he was beginning 
to see that the world was immense and subtle and that there were many things 
to learn about women that he had never dreamed of christina channing was a rival 
of angela's in one sense that of bodily beauty she had a tall perfectly rounded 
form a lovely oval face a nut brown complexion with the rosy glow of health 
showing in cheeks and lips and a mass of blue black hair her great brown 
eyes were lustrous and sympathetic eugene met her through the good offices of shotmeyer who 
had been given by some common friend in boston a letter of introduction to her 
he had spoken of eugene as being a very brilliant young artist and his friend 
and remarked that he would like to bring him up some evening to hear her 
sing miss channing acquiesced for she had seen some of his drawings and was struck 
by the poetic note in them shotmeyer vain of his notable acquaintanceswho in fact tolerated 
him for his amusing gossipdescribed miss channing's voice to eugene and asked him if he 
did not want to call on her some evening delighted said eugene the appointment was 
made and together they went to miss channing's suite in a superior nineteenth street boarding 
house miss channing received them arrayed in a smooth close fitting dress of black velvet 
touched with red eugene was reminded of the first costume in which he had seen 
ruby he was dazzled as for her as she told him afterward she was conscious 
of a peculiar illogical perturbation when i put on my ribbon that night she told 
him i was going to put on a dark blue silk one i had just 
bought and then i thought 'no he'll like me better in a red one' isn't 
that curious i just felt as though you were going to like meas though we 
might know each other better that young manwhat's his namedescribed you so accurately it was 
months afterward when she confessed that when eugene entered it was with the grand air 
he had acquired since his life had begun to broaden in the east he took 
his relationship with talent particularly female talent seriously he stood up very straight walked with 
a noticeable stride drove an examining glance into the very soul of the person he 
was looking at he was quick to get impressions especially of talent he could feel 
ability in another when he looked at miss channing he felt it like a strong 
wavethe vibrating wave of an intense consciousness she greeted him extending a soft white hand 
they spoke of how they had heard of each other eugene somehow made her feel 
his enthusiasm for her art music is the finer thing he said when she spoke 
of his own gift christina's dark brown eyes swept him from head to foot he 
was like his pictures she thoughtand as good to look at he was introduced to 
her mother they sat down talking and presently miss channing sangche faro senza euridice eugene 
felt as if she were singing to him her cheeks were flushed and her lips 
red her mother remarked after she had finished you're in splendid voice this evening christina 
i feel particularly fit she replied a wonderful voiceit's like a big red poppy or 
a great yellow orchid cried eugene christina thrilled the description caught her fancy it seemed 
true she felt something of that in the sounds to which she gave utterance please 
sing 'who is sylvia' he begged a little later she complied gladly that was written 
for you he said softly as she ceased for he had come close to the 
piano you image sylvia for me her cheeks colored warmly thanks she nodded and her 
eyes spoke too she welcomed his daring and she was glad to let him know 
it chapter xxii the chief trouble with his present situation and with the entrance of 
these two women into his life and it had begun to be a serious one 
to him was that he was not making money he had been able to earn 
about the first year the second he made a little over two thousand and this 
third year he was possibly doing a little better but in view of what he 
saw around him and what he now knew of life it was nothing new york 
presented a spectacle of material display such as he had never known existed the carriages 
on fifth avenue the dinners at the great hotels the constant talk of society functions 
in the newspapers made his brain dizzy he was inclined to idle about the streets 
to watch the handsomely dressed crowds to consider the evidences of show and refinement everywhere 
and he came to the conclusion that he was not living at all but existing 
art as he had first dreamed of it art had seemed not only a road 
to distinction but also to affluence now as he studied those about him he found 
that it was not so artists were never tremendously rich he learned he remembered reading 
in balzac's story cousin betty of a certain artist of great distinction who had been 
allowed condescendingly by one of the rich families of paris to marry a daughter but 
it was considered a great come down for her he had hardly been able to 
credit the idea at the time so exalted was his notion of the artist but 
now he was beginning to see that it represented the world's treatment of artists there 
were in america a few who were very popularmeretriciously so he thought in certain caseswho 
were said to be earning from ten to fifteen thousand a year how high would 
that place them he asked himself in that world of real luxury which was made 
up of the socalled four hundredthe people of immense wealth and social position he had 
read in the papers that it took from fifteen to twentyfive thousand dollars a year 
to clothe a débutante it was nothing uncommon he heard for a man to spend 
from fifteen to twenty dollars on his dinner at the restaurant the prices he heard 
that tailors demandedthat dressmakers commanded the display of jewels and expensive garments at the opera 
made the poor little income of an artist look like nothing at all miss finch 
was constantly telling him of the show and swagger she met with in her circle 
of acquaintances for her tact and adaptability had gained her the friendship of a number 
of society people miss channing when he came to know her better made constant references 
to things she came in contact withgreat singers or violinists paid a night or the 
tremendous salaries commanded by the successful opera stars he began as he looked at his 
own meagre little income to feel shabby again and run down much as he had 
during those first days in chicago why art outside the fame was nothing it did 
not make for real living it made for a kind of mental blooming which everybody 
recognized but you could be a poor sick hungry shabby geniusyou actually could look at 
verlaine who had recently died in paris a part of this feeling was due to 
the opening of a golden age of luxury in new york and the effect the 
reiterated sight of it was having on eugene huge fortunes had been amassed in the 
preceding fifty years and now there were thousands of residents in the great new city 
who were worth anything from one to fifty and in some instances a hundred million 
dollars the metropolitan area particularly manhattan island above fiftyninth street was growing like a weed 
great hotels were being erected in various parts of the socalled white light district there 
was beginning just then the first organized attempt of capital to supply a new needthe 
modern sumptuous eight ten and twelve story apartment house which was to house the world 
of newly rich middle class folk who were pouring into new york from every direction 
money was being made in the west the south and the north and as soon 
as those who were making it had sufficient to permit them to live in luxury 
for the rest of their days they were moving east occupying these expensive apartments crowding 
the great hotels patronizing the sumptuous restaurants giving the city its air of spendthrift luxury 
all the things which catered to showy material living were beginning to flourish tremendously art 
and curio shops rug shops decorative companies dealing with the old and the new in 
hangings furniture objects of art dealers in paintings jewelry stores china and glassware housesanything and 
everything which goes to make life comfortable and brilliant eugene as he strolled about the 
city saw this felt the change realized that the drift was toward greater population greater 
luxury greater beauty his mind was full of the necessity of living now he was 
young now he was vigorous now he was keen now in a few years he 
might not beseventy years was the allotted span and twentyfive of his had already gone 
how would it be if he never came into this luxury was never allowed to 
enter society was never permitted to live as wealth was now living the thought hurt 
him he felt an eager desire to tear wealth and fame from the bosom of 
the world life must give him his share if it did not he would curse 
it to his dying day so he felt when he was approaching twentysix the effect 
of christina channing's friendship for him was particularly to emphasize this she was not so 
much older than he was possessed of very much the same temperament the same hopes 
and aspirations and she discerned almost as clearly as he did the current of events 
new york was to witness a golden age of luxury it was already passing into 
it those who rose to distinction in any field particularly music or the stage were 
likely to share in a most notable spectacle of luxury christina hoped to she was 
sure she would after a few conversations with eugene she was inclined to feel that 
he would he was so brilliant so incisive you have such a way with you 
she said the second time he came you are so commanding you make me think 
you can do almost anything you want to oh no he deprecated not as bad 
as that i have just as much trouble as anyone getting what i want oh 
but you will though you have ideas it did not take these two long to 
reach an understanding they confided to each other their individual histories with reservations of course 
at first christina told him of her musical history beginning at hagerstown maryland and he 
went back to his earliest days in alexandria they discussed the differences in parental control 
to which they had been subject he learned of her father's business which was that 
of oyster farming and confessed on his part to being the son of a sewing 
machine agent they talked of small town influences early illusions the different things they had 
tried to do she had sung in the local methodist church had once thought she 
would like to be a milliner had fallen in the hands of a teacher who 
tried to get her to marry him and she had been on the verge of 
consenting something happenedshe went away for the summer or something of that sort and changed 
her mind after an evening at the theatre with her a late supper one night 
and a third call to spend a quiet evening in her room he took her 
by the hand she was standing by the piano and he was looking at her 
cheeks her large inquiring eyes her smooth rounded neck and chin you like me he 
said suddenly à propos of nothing save the mutual attraction that was always running strong 
between them without hesitation she nodded her head though the bright blood mounted to her 
neck and cheeks you are so lovely to me he went on that words are 
of no value i can paint you or you can sing me what you are 
but mere words won't show it i have been in love before but never with 
anyone like you are you in love she asked naïvely what is this he asked 
and slipped his arms about her drawing her close she turned her head away leaving 
her rosy cheek near his lips he kissed that then her mouth and her neck 
he held her chin and looked into her eyes be careful she said mamma may 
come in hang mamma he laughed she'll hang you if she sees you mamma would 
never suspect me of anything like this that shows how little mamma knows of her 
christina he answered she knows enough at that she confessed gaily oh if we were 
only up in the mountains now she added what mountains he inquired curiously the blue 
ridge we have a bungalow up at florizel you must come up when we go 
there next summer will mamma be there he asked and papa she laughed and i 
suppose cousin annie no brother george will be nix for the bungalow he replied using 
a slang word that had become immensely popular oh but i know all the country 
round there there are some lovely walks and drives she said this archly naïvely suggestively 
her bright face lit with an intelligence that seemed perfection wellsuch being the case he 
smiled and meanwhile oh meanwhile you just have to wait you see how things are 
she nodded her head towards an inside room where mrs channing was lying down with 
a slight headache mamma doesn't leave me very often eugene did not know exactly how 
to take christina he had never encountered this attitude before her directness in connection with 
so much talent such real ability rather took him by surprise he did not expect 
itdid not think she would confess affection for him did not know just what she 
meant by speaking in the way she did of the bungalow and florizel he was 
flattered raised in his own selfesteem if such a beautiful talented creature as this could 
confess her love for him what a personage he must be and she was thinking 
of freer conditionsjust what he did not want to press the matter too closely then 
and she was not anxious to have him do soshe preferred to be enigmatic but 
there was a light of affection and admiration in her eye which made him very 
proud and happy with things just as they were as she said there was little 
chance for lovemaking under conditions then existing her mother was with her most of the 
time christina invited eugene to come and hear her sing at the philharmonic concerts so 
once in a great ballroom at the waldorfastoria and again in the imposing auditorium of 
carnegie hall and a third time in the splendid auditorium of the arion society he 
had the pleasure of seeing her walk briskly to the footlights the great orchestra waiting 
the audience expectant herself arch assuredalmost defiant he thought and so beautiful when the great 
house thundered its applause he was basking in one delicious memory of her last night 
she had her arms about my neck tonight when i call and we are alone 
she will kiss me that beautiful distinguished creature standing there bowing and smiling loves me 
and no one else if i were to ask her she would marry meif i 
were in a position and had the means if i were in a position that 
thought cut him for he knew that he was not he could not marry her 
in reality she would not have him knowing how little he madeor would she he 
wondered chapter xxiii towards the end of spring eugene concluded he would rather go up 
in the mountains near christina's bungalow this summer than back to see angela the memory 
of that precious creature was under the stress and excitement of metropolitan life becoming a 
little tarnished his recollections of her were as delightful as ever as redolent of beauty 
but he was beginning to wonder the smart crowd in new york was composed of 
a different type angela was sweet and lovely but would she fit in meanwhile miriam 
finch with her subtle eclecticism continued her education of eugene she was as good as 
a school he would sit and listen to her descriptions of plays her appreciation of 
books her summing up of current philosophies and he would almost feel himself growing she 
knew so many people could tell him where to go to see just such and 
such an important thing all the startling personalities the worth while preachers the new actors 
somehow she knew all about them now eugene she would exclaim on seeing him you 
positively must go and see haydon boyd in 'the signet' orsee elmina deming in her 
new dances orlook at the pictures of winslow homer that are being shown at knoedler's 
she would explain with exactness why she wanted him to see them what she thought 
they would do for him she frankly confessed to him that she considered him a 
genius and always insisted on knowing what new thing he was doing when any work 
of his appeared and she liked it she was swift to tell him he almost 
felt as if he owned her room and herself as if all that she washer 
ideas her friends her experiencesbelonged to him he could go and draw on them by 
sitting at her feet or going with her somewhere when spring came she liked to 
walk with him to listen to his comments on nature and life that's splendid she 
would exclaim now why don't you write that or why don't you paint that he 
showed her some of his poems once and she had made copies of them and 
pasted them in a book of what she called exceptional things so he was coddled 
by her in another way christina was equally nice she was fond of telling eugene 
how much she thought of him how nice she thought he was you're so big 
and smarty she said to him once affectionately pinioning his arms and looking into his 
eyes i like the way you part your hair too you're kind o' like an 
artist ought to be that's the way to spoil me he replied let me tell 
you how nice you are want to know how nice you are uhuh she smiled 
shaking her head to mean no wait till we get to the mountains i'll tell 
you he sealed her lips with his holding her until her breath was almost gone 
oh she exclaimed you're terrible you're like steel and you're like a big red rose 
kiss me from christina he learned all about the musical world and musical personalities he 
gained an insight into the different forms of music operatic symphonic instrumental he learned of 
the different forms of composition the terminology the mystery of the vocal cords the methods 
of training he learned of the jealousies within the profession and what the best musical 
authorities thought of such and such composers or singers he learned how difficult it was 
to gain a place in the operatic world how bitterly singers fought each other how 
quick the public was to desert a fading star christina took it all so unconcernedly 
that he almost loved her for her courage she was so wise and so good 
natured you have to give up a lot of things to be a good artist 
she said to eugene one day you can't have the ordinary life and art too 
just what do you mean chrissy he asked petting her hand for they were alone 
together why you can't get married very well and have children and you can't do 
much in a social way oh i know they do get married but sometimes i 
think it is a mistake most of the singers i know don't do so very 
well tied down by marriage don't you intend to get married asked eugene curiously i 
don't know she replied realizing what he was driving at i'd want to think about 
that a woman artist is in a d of a position anyway using the letter 
d only to indicate the word devil she has so many things to think about 
for instance oh what people think and her family think and i don't know what 
all they ought to get a new sex for artistslike they have for worker bees 
eugene smiled he knew what she was driving at but he did not know how 
long she had been debating the problem of her virginity as conflicting with her love 
of distinction in art she was nearly sure she did not want to complicate her 
art life with marriage she was almost positive that success on the operatic stageparticularly the 
great opportunity for the beginner abroadwas complicated with some liaison some escaped but it was 
not many she was wondering in her own mind whether she owed it to current 
morality to remain absolutely pure it was assumed generally that girls should remain virtuous and 
marry but this did not necessarily apply to hershould it apply to the artistic temperament 
her mother and her family troubled her she was virtuous but youth and desire had 
given her some bitter moments and here was eugene to emphasize it it is a 
difficult problem he said sympathetically wondering what she would eventually do he felt keenly that 
her attitude in regard to marriage affected his relationship to her was she wedded to 
her art at the expense of love it's a big problem she said and went 
to the piano to sing he half suspected for a little while after this that 
she might be contemplating some radical stepwhat he did not care to say to himself 
but he was intensely interested in her problem this peculiar freedom of thought astonished himbroadened 
his horizon he wondered what his sister myrtle would think of a girl discussing marriage 
in this waythe to be or not to be of itwhat sylvia he wondered if 
many girls did that most of the women he had known seemed to think more 
logically along these lines than he did he remembered asking ruby once whether she didn't 
think illicit love was wrong and hearing her reply no some people thought it was 
wrong but that didn't make it so to her here was another girl with another 
theory they talked more of love and he wondered why she wanted him to come 
up to florizel in the summer she could not be thinkingno she was too conservative 
he began to suspect though that she would not marry himwould not marry anyone at 
present she merely wanted to be loved for awhile no doubt may came and with 
it the end of christina's concert work and voice study so far as new york 
was concerned she had been in and out of the city all the winterto pittsburgh 
buffalo chicago st paul and now after a winter's hard work retired to hagerstown with 
her mother for a few weeks prior to leaving for florizel you ought to come 
down here she wrote to eugene early in june there is a sickle moon that 
shines in my garden and the roses are in bloom oh the odors are so 
sweet and the dew some of our windows open out level with the grass and 
i sing i sing i sing he had a notion to run down but restrained 
himself for she told him that they were leaving in two weeks for the mountains 
he had a set of drawings to complete for a magazine for which they were 
in a hurry so he decided to wait till that was done in late june 
he went up to the blue ridge in southern pennsylvania where florizel was situated he 
thought at first he would be invited to stay at the channing bungalow but christina 
warned him that it would be safer and better for him to stay at one 
of the adjoining hotels there were several on the slope of adjacent hills at prices 
ranging from five to ten dollars a day though this was high for eugene he 
decided to go he wanted to be with this marvellous creatureto see just what she 
did mean by wishing they were in the mountains together he had saved some eight 
hundred dollars which was in a savings bank and he withdrew three hundred for his 
little outing he took christina a very handsomely bound copy of villon of whom she 
was fond and several volumes of new verse most of these chosen according to his 
most recent mood were sad in their poetic texture they all preached the nothingness of 
life its sadness albeit the perfection of its beauty at this time eugene had quite 
reached the conclusion that there was no hereafterthere was nothing save blind dark force moving 
aimlesslywhere formerly he had believed vaguely in a heaven and had speculated as to a 
possible hell his reading had led him through some main roads and some odd bypaths 
of logic and philosophy he was an omnivorous reader now and a fairly logical thinker 
he had already tackled spencer's first principles which had literally torn him up by the 
roots and set him adrift and from that had gone back to marcus aurelius epictetus 
spinoza and schopenhauermen who ripped out all his private theories and made him wonder what 
life really was he had walked the streets for a long time after reading some 
of these things speculating on the play of forces the decay of matter the fact 
that thoughtforms had no more stability than cloudforms philosophies came and went governments came and 
went races arose and disappeared he walked into the great natural history museum of new 
york once to discover enormous skeletons of prehistoric animalsthings said to have lived two three 
five millions of years before his day and he marvelled at the forces which produced 
them the indifference apparently with which they had been allowed to die nature seemed lavish 
of its types and utterly indifferent to the persistence of anything he came to the 
conclusion that he was nothing a mere shell a sound a leaf which had no 
general significance and for the time being it almost broke his heart it tended to 
smash his egotism to tear away his intellectual pride he wandered about dazed hurt moody 
like a lost child but he was thinking persistently then came darwin huxley tyndall lubbocka 
whole string of british thinkers who fortified the original conclusions of the others but showed 
him a beauty a formality a lavishness of form and idea in nature's methods which 
fairly transfixed him he was still readingpoets naturalists essayists but he was still gloomy life 
was nothing save dark forces moving aimlessly the manner in which he applied this thinking 
to his life was characteristic and individual to think that beauty should blossom for a 
little while and disappear for ever seemed sad to think that his life should endure 
but for seventy years and then be no more was terrible he and angela were 
chance acquaintanceschemical affinitiesnever to meet again in all time he and christina he and rubyhe 
and anyonea few bright hours were all they could have together and then would come 
the great silence dissolution and he would never be anymore it hurt him to think 
of this but it made him all the more eager to live to be loved 
while he was here if he could only have a lovely girl's arms to shut 
him in safely always it was while he was in this mood that he reached 
florizel after a long night's ride and christina who was a good deal of a 
philosopher and thinker herself at times was quick to notice it she was waiting at 
the depot with a dainty little trap of her own to take him for a 
drive the trap rolled out along the soft yellow dusty roads the mountain dew was 
still in the earth though and the dust was heavy with damp and not flying 
green branches of trees hung low over them charming vistas came into view at every 
turn eugene kissed her for there was no one to see twisting her head to 
kiss her lips at leisure it's a blessed thing this horse is tame or we'd 
be in for some accident what makes you so moody she said i'm not moodyor 
am i i've been thinking a lot of things of lateof you principally do i 
make you sad from one point of view yes and what is that sir she 
asked with an assumption of severity you are so beautiful so wonderful and life is 
so short you have only fifty years to love me in she laughed calculating his 
age oh eugene what a boy you arewait a minute she added after a pause 
drawing the horse to a stop under some trees hold these she said offering him 
the reins he took them and she put her arms about his neck now you 
silly she exclaimed i love you love you love you there was never anyone quite 
like you will that help you she smiled into his eyes yes he answered but 
it isn't enough seventy years isn't enough eternity isn't enough of life as it is 
now as it is now she echoed and then took the reins for she felt 
what he felt the need of persistent youth and persistent beauty to keep it as 
it should be and these things would not stay chapter xxiv the days spent in 
the mountains were seventeen exactly and during that time with christina eugene reached a curious 
exaltation of spirit different from anything he had experienced before in the first place he 
had never known a girl like christina so beautiful so perfect physically so incisive mentally 
so full of a fine artistic perception she was so quick to perceive exactly what 
he meant she was so suggestive to him in her own thoughts and feelings the 
mysteries of life employed her mind quite as fully as they did his she thought 
much of the subtlety of the human body of its mysterious emotions of its conscious 
and subconscious activities and relationships the passions the desires the necessities of life were as 
a fine tapestry for her mind to contemplate she had no time to sit down 
and formulate her thoughts she did not want to writebut she worked out through her 
emotions and through her singing the beautiful and pathetic things she felt and she could 
talk in a fine poetic melancholy vein on occasion though there was so much courage 
and strength in her young blood that she was not afraid of any phase of 
life or what nature might do with the little substance which she called herself when 
it should dissolve time and change happeneth to us all she would quote to eugene 
and he would gravely nod his head the hotel where he stopped was more pretentious 
than any he had been previously acquainted with he had never had so much money 
in his life before nor had he ever felt called upon to spend it lavishly 
the room he took wasbecause of what christina might thinkone of the best he took 
christina's suggestion and invited her her mother and her brother to dinner on several occasions 
the remainder of the family had not arrived yet in return he was invited to 
breakfast to lunch and dinner at the bungalow christina showed on his arrival that she 
had planned to be with him alone as much as possible for she suggested that 
they make expeditions to high hill to bold face and the chimneythree surrounding mountains she 
knew of good hotels at seven ten fifteen miles distance to which they could go 
by train or else they drive and return by moonlight she had selected two or 
three secluded spots in thickets and groves where the trees gave way to little open 
spaces of grass and in these they would string a hammock scatter their books of 
verse about and sit down to enjoy the delights of talk and lovemaking under the 
influence of this companionship under cloudless skies and in the heart of the june weather 
christina finally yielded to an arrangement which brought eugene into a relationship which he had 
never dreamed possible with her they had progressed by degrees through all the subtleties of 
courtship they had come to discuss the nature of passion and emotion and had swept 
aside as negligible the conviction that there was any inherent evil in the most intimate 
relationship at last christina said frankly: i don't want to be married it isn't for 
menot until i've thoroughly succeeded anyhow i'd rather waitif i could just have you and 
singleness too why do you want to yield yourself to me eugene asked curiously i 
don't know that i exactly want to i could do with just your loveif you 
were satisfied it's you that i want to make happy i want to give you 
anything you want curious girl observed her lover smoothing her high forehead with his hand 
i don't understand you christina i don't know how your mind works why should you 
you have everything to lose if worst came to worst oh no she smiled i'd 
marry you then but to do this out of hand because you love me because 
you want me to be happy he paused i don't understand it either honey boy 
she offered i just do but why if you are willing to do this you 
wouldn't prefer to live with me is what i don't understand she took his face 
between her hands i think i understand you better than you do yourself i don't 
think you'd be happy married you might not always love me i might not always 
love you you might come to regret if we could be happy now you might 
reach the point where you wouldn't care any more then you see i wouldn't be 
remorseful thinking that we had never known happiness what logic he exclaimed do you mean 
to say you wouldn't care any more oh i'd care but not in the same 
way don't you see eugene i would have the satisfaction of knowing that even if 
we did separate you had had the best of me it seemed astounding to eugene 
that she should talk in this wayreason this way what a curious sacrificial fatalistic turn 
of mind could a young beautiful talented girl really be like this would anybody on 
earth really believe it if they knew he looked at her and shook his head 
sorrowfully to think that the quintessence of life should not stay with us always he 
sighed no honey boy she replied you want too much you think you want it 
to stay but you don't you want it to go you wouldn't be satisfied to 
live with me always i know it take what the gods provide and have no 
regrets refuse to think you can you know eugene gathered her up in his arms 
he kissed her over and over forgetting in her embrace all the loves he had 
ever known she yielded herself to him gladly joyously telling him over and over that 
it made her happy if you could only see how nice you are to me 
you wouldn't wonder she explained he concluded she was the most wonderful being he had 
ever known no woman had ever revealed herself to him so unselfishly in love no 
woman he had ever known appeared to have the courage and the insight to go 
thus simply and directly to what she desired to hear an artist of her power 
a girl of her beauty discussing calmly whether she should sacrifice her virtue to love 
whether marriage in the customary form was good for her art whether she should take 
him now when they were young or bow to the conventions and let youth pass 
was enough to shock his still trammelled soul for after all and despite his desire 
for personal freedom his intellectual doubts and mental exceptions he still had a profound reverence 
for a home such as that maintained by jotham blue and his wife and for 
its results in the form of normal healthy dutiful children nature had no doubt attained 
to this standard through a long series of difficulties and experiments and she would not 
readily relinquish it was it really necessary to abandon it entirely did he want to 
see a world in which a woman would take him for a little while as 
christina was doing now and then leave him his experience here was making him think 
throwing his theories and ideas up in the air making a mess of all the 
notions he had ever formed about things he racked his brain over the intricacies of 
sex and life sitting on the great verandas of the hotel and wondering over and 
over just what the answer was and why he could not like other men be 
faithful to one woman and be happy he wondered whether this was really so and 
whether he could not it seemed to him then that he might he knew that 
he did not understand himself very clearly that he had no grasp on himself at 
all as yethis tendencies his possibilities these days under such halcyon conditions made a profound 
impression on him he was struck with the perfection life could reach at odd moments 
these great quiet hills so uniform in their roundness so green so peaceful rested his 
soul he and christina climbed one day two thousand feet to a ledge which jutted 
out over a valley and commanded what seemed to him the kingdoms and the powers 
of the earthvast stretches of green land and subdivided fields little cottage settlements and towns 
great hills that stood up like friendly brothers to this one in the distance see 
that man down in that yard said christina pointing to a speck of a being 
chopping wood in a front space serving as a garden to a country cottage fully 
a mile distant where asked eugene see where that red barn is just this side 
of that clump of treesdon't you see there where the cows are in that field 
i don't see any cows oh eugene what's the matter with your eyes oh now 
i see he replied squeezing her fingers he looks like a cockroach doesn't he yes 
she laughed how wide the earth is and how small we are now think of 
that speck with all his hopes and ambitionsall the machinery of his brain and nerves 
and tell me whether any god can care how can he christina he can't care 
for any one particular speck much sweet he might care for the idea of man 
or a race of men as a whole still i'm not sure honey all i 
know is that i'm happy now and i he echoed still they dug at this 
problem the question of the origin of lifeits why the tremendous and wearisome age of 
the earth the veritable storms of birth and death that seemed to have raged at 
different periods held them in discussion we can't solve it eugenio mio she laughed we 
might as well go home poor dear mamma will be wondering where her christina is 
you know i think she suspects that i'm falling in love with you she doesn't 
care how many men fall in love with me but if i show the least 
sign of a strong preference she begins to worry have there been many preferences he 
inquired no but don't ask what difference does it make oh eugene what difference does 
it make i love you now i don't know what difference it makes he replied 
only there is an ache that goes with the thought of previous experience i can't 
tell you why it is it just is she looked thoughtfully away anyhow no man 
ever was to me before what you have been isn't that enough doesn't that speak 
yes yes sweet it does oh yes it does forgive me i won't grieve any 
more don't please she said you hurt me as much as you hurt yourself there 
were evenings when he sat on some one of the great verandas and watched them 
trim and string the interspaces between the columns with soft glowing chinese lanterns preparatory to 
the evening's dancing he loved to see the girls and men of the summer colony 
arrive the former treading the soft grass in filmy white gowns and white slippers the 
latter in white ducks and flannels gaily chatting as they came christina would come to 
these affairs with her mother and brother beautifully clad in white linen or lawns and 
laces and he would be beside himself with chagrin that he had not practised dancing 
to the perfection of the art he could dance now but not like her brother 
or scores of men he saw upon the waxen floor it hurt him at times 
he would sit all alone after his splendid evenings with his love dreaming of the 
beauty of it all the stars would be as a great wealth of diamond seed 
flung from the lavish hand of an aimless sower the hills would loom dark and 
tall there was peace and quiet everywhere why may not life be always like this 
he would ask and then he would answer himself out of his philosophy that it 
would become deadly after awhile as does all unchanging beauty the call of the soul 
is for motion not peace peace after activity for a little while then activity again 
so must it be he understood that just before he left for new york christina 
said to him: now when you see me again i will be miss channing of 
new york you will be mr witla we will almost forget that we were ever 
here together we will scarcely believe that we have seen what we have seen and 
done what we have done but christina you talk as though everything were over it 
isn't is it we can't do anything like this in new york she sighed i 
haven't time and you must work there was a shade of finality in her tone 
oh christina don't talk so i can't think that way please don't i won't she 
said we'll see wait till i get back he kissed her a dozen farewells and 
at the door held her close once more will you forsake me he asked no 
you will forsake me but remember dear don't you see you've had all let me 
be your wood nymph the rest is commonplace he went back to his hotel with 
an ache in his heart for he knew they had gone through all they ever 
would she had had her summer with him she had given him of herself fully 
she wanted to be free to work now he could not understand it but he 
knew it to be so chapter xxv it is a rather dreary thing to come 
back into the hot city in the summer after a period of beauty in the 
mountains the quiet of the hills was in eugene's mind the glisten and babble of 
mountain streams the soar and poise of hawks and buzzards and eagles sailing the crystal 
blue he felt lonely and sick for awhile out of touch with work and with 
practical life generally there were little souvenirs of his recent happiness in the shape of 
letters and notes from christina but he was full of the premonition of the end 
which had troubled him on leaving he must write to angela he had not thought 
of her all the time he had been gone he had been in the habit 
of writing to her every third or fourth day at least while of late his 
letters had been less passionate they had remained fairly regular but now this sudden break 
comingit was fully three weeksmade her think he must be ill although she had begun 
to feel also that he might be changing his letters had grown steadily less reminiscent 
of the joys they had experienced together and of the happiness they were anticipating and 
more inclined to deal with the color and character of city life and of what 
he hoped to achieve angela was inclined to excuse much of this on the grounds 
of the special effort he was making to achieve distinction and a living income for 
themselves but it was hard to explain three weeks of silence without something quite serious 
having happened eugene understood this he tried to explain it on the grounds of illness 
stating that he was now up and feeling much better but when his explanation came 
it had the hollow ring of insincerity angela wondered what the truth could be was 
he yielding to the temptation of that looser life that all artists were supposed to 
lead she wondered and worried for time was slipping away and he was setting no 
definite date for their much discussed nuptials the trouble with angela's position was that the 
delay involved practically everything which was important in her life she was five years older 
than eugene she had long since lost that atmosphere of youth and buoyancy which is 
so characteristic of a girl between eighteen and twentytwo those few short years following when 
the body of maidenhood blooms like a rose and there is about it the freshness 
and color of all rich new lush life were behind her ahead was that persistent 
decline towards something harder shrewder and less beautiful in the case of some persons the 
decline is slow and the fragrance of youth lingers for years the artifices of the 
dressmaker the chemist and the jeweller being but little needed in others it is fast 
and no contrivance will stay the ravages of a restless eager dissatisfied soul sometimes art 
combines with slowness of decay to make a woman of almost perennial charm loveliness of 
mind matching loveliness of body and taste and tact supplementing both angela was fortunate in 
being slow to fade and she had a loveliness of imagination and emotion to sustain 
her but she had also a restless anxious disposition of mind which if it had 
not been stayed by the kindly color of her home life and by the fortunate 
or unfortunate intervention of eugene at a time when she considered her ideal of love 
to have fairly passed out of the range of possibility would already have set on 
her face the signs of old maidenhood she was not of the newer order of 
femininity eager to get out in the world and follow some individual line of selfdevelopment 
and interest rather was she a home woman wanting some one man to look after 
and love the wonder and beauty of her dream of happiness with eugene now made 
the danger of its loss and the possible compulsory continuance of a humdrum underpaid backwoods 
existence heartsickening meanwhile as the summer passed eugene was casually enlarging his acquaintance with women 
machugh and smite had gone back home for the summer and it was a relief 
from his loneliness to encounter one day in an editorial office norma whitmore a dark 
keen temperamental and moody but brilliant writer and editor who like others before her took 
a fancy to eugene she was introduced to him by jans jansen art director of 
the paper and after some light banter she offered to show him her office she 
led the way to a little room no larger than six by eight where she 
had her desk eugene noticed that she was lean and sallow about his own age 
or older and brilliant and vivacious her hands took his attention for they were thin 
shapely and artistic her eyes burned with a peculiar lustre and her loosefitting clothes were 
draped artistically about her a conversation sprang up as to his work which she knew 
and admired and he was invited to her apartment he looked at norma with an 
unconsciously speculative eye christina was out of the city but the memory of her made 
it impossible for him to write to angela in his old vein of devotion nevertheless 
he still thought of her as charming he thought that he ought to write more 
regularly he thought that he ought pretty soon to go back and marry her he 
was approaching the point where he could support her in a studio if they lived 
economically but he did not want to exactly he had known her now for three 
years it was fully a year and a half since he had seen her last 
in the last year his letters had been less and less about themselves and more 
and more about everything else he was finding the conventional love letters difficult but he 
did not permit himself to realize just what that meantto take careful stock of his 
emotions that would have compelled him to the painful course of deciding that he could 
not marry her and asking her to be released from his promise he did not 
want to do that instead he parleyed held by pity for her passing youth and 
her undeniable affection for him by his sense of the unfairness of having taken up 
so much of her time to the exclusion of every other person who might have 
proposed to her by sorrow for the cruelty of her position in being left to 
explain to her family that she had been jilted he hated to hurt any person's 
feelings he did not want to be conscious of the grief of any person who 
had come to suffering through him and he could not make them suffer very well 
and not be conscious he was too tender hearted he had pledged himself to angela 
giving her a ring begging her to wait writing her fulsome letters of protest and 
desire now after three years to shame her before her charming familyold jotham her mother 
her sisters and brothersit seemed a cruel thing to do and he did not care 
to contemplate it angela with her morbid passionate apprehensive nature did not fail to see 
disaster looming in the distance she loved eugene passionately and the pentup fires of her 
nature had been waiting all these years the warrant to express their ardor which marriage 
alone could confer eugene by the charm of his manner and person no less than 
by the sensuous character of some of his moods and the subtleties and refinements of 
his references to the ties of sex had stirred her to anticipate a perfect fruition 
of her dreams and she was now eager for that fruition almost to the point 
of being willing to sacrifice virginity itself the remembrance of the one significant scene between 
her and eugene tormented her she felt that if his love was to terminate in 
indifference now it would have been better to have yielded then she wished that she 
had not tried to save herself perhaps there would have been a child and he 
would have been true to her out of a sense of sympathy and duty at 
least she would have had that crowning glory of womanhood ardent union with her lover 
and if worst had come to worst she could have died she thought of the 
quiet little lake near her home its glassy bosom a mirror to the sky and 
how in case of failure she would have looked lying on its sandy bottom her 
pale hair diffused by some aimless motion of the water her eyes sealed by the 
end of consciousness her hands folded her fancy outran her daring she would not have 
done this but she could dream about it and it made her distress all the 
more intense as time went by and eugene's ardor did not revive this problem of 
her love became more harrassing and she began to wonder seriously what she could do 
to win him back to her he had expressed such a violent desire for her 
on his last visit had painted his love in such glowing terms that she felt 
convinced he must love her still though absence and the excitements of city life had 
dimmed the memory of her temporarily she remembered a line in a comic opera which 
she and eugene had seen together: absence is the dark room in which lovers develop 
negatives and this seemed a case in point if she could get him back if 
he could be near her again his old fever would develop and she would then 
find some way of making him take her perhaps it did not occur to her 
quite clearly just how this could be done at this time but some vague notion 
of selfimmolation was already stirring vaguely and disturbingly in her brain the trying and in 
a way disheartening conditions of her home went some way to sustain this notion her 
sister marietta was surrounded by a score of suitors who were as eager for her 
love as a bee is for the honey of a flower and angela could see 
that they were already looking upon herself as an elderly chaperon her mother and father 
watched her going about her work and grieved because so good a girl should be 
made to suffer for want of a proper understanding she could not conceal her feelings 
entirely and they could see at times that she was unhappy she could see that 
they saw it it was hard to have to explain to her sisters and brothers 
who occasionally asked after eugene that he was doing all right and never be able 
to say that he was coming for her some day soon at first marietta had 
been envious of her she thought she would like to win eugene for herself and 
only consideration for angela's age and the fact that she had not been so much 
sought after had deterred her now that eugene was obviously neglecting her or at least 
delaying beyond any reasonable period she was deeply sorry once before she had grown into 
the age of courtship she had said to angela: i'm going to be nice to 
the men you're too cold you'll never get married and angela had realized that it 
was not a matter of too cold but an innate prejudice against most of the 
types she met and then the average man did not take to her she could 
not spur herself to pleasure in their company it took a fire like eugene's to 
stir her mightily and once having known that she could brook no other marietta realized 
this too now because of these three years she had cut herself off from other 
men particularly the one who had been most attentive to herfaithful victor dean the one 
thing that might save angela from being completely ignored was a spirit of romance which 
kept her young in looks as in feelings with the fear of desertion in her 
mind angela began to hint in her letters to eugene that he should come back 
to see her to express the hope in her letters that their marriage need notbecause 
of any difficulty of establishing himselfbe postponed much longer she said to him over and 
over that she could be happy with him in a cottage and that she so 
longed to see him again eugene began to ask himself what he wanted to do 
the fact that on the passional side angela appealed to him more than any woman 
he had ever known was a saving point in her favor at this juncture there 
was a note in her makeup which was stronger deeper more suggestive of joy to 
come than anything he had found elsewhere he remembered keenly the wonderful days he had 
spent with herthe one significant night when she begged him to save her against herself 
all the beauty of the season with which she was surrounded at that time the 
charm of her family the odor of flowers and the shade of trees served to 
make a setting for her delightfulness which still endured with him as fresh as yesterday 
now without having completed that romancea very perfect flowercould he cast it aside at this 
time he was not entangled with any woman miriam finch was too conservative and intellectual 
norma whitmore not attractive enough as for some other charming examples of femininity whom he 
had met here and there he had not been drawn to them or they to 
him emotionally he was lonely and this for him was always a very susceptible mood 
he could not make up his mind that the end had come with angela it 
so happened that marietta after watching her sister's love affair some time reached the conclusion 
that she ought to try to help her angela was obviously concealing a weariness of 
heart which was telling on her peace of mind and her sweetness of disposition she 
was unhappy and it grieved her sister greatly the latter loved her in a wholehearted 
way in spite of the fact that their affections might possibly have clashed over eugene 
and she thought once of writing in a sweet way and telling him how things 
were she thought he was good and kind that he loved angela that perhaps he 
was delaying as her sister said until he should have sufficient means to marry well 
and that if the right word were said now he would cease chasing a phantom 
fortune long enough to realize that it were better to take angela while they were 
still young than to wait until they were so old that the romance of marriage 
would for them be over she revolved this in her mind a long time picturing 
to herself how sweet angela really was and finally nerved herself to pen the following 
letter which she sent dear eugene: you will be surprised to get a letter from 
me and i want you to promise me that you will never say anything about 
it to anyoneabove all never to angela eugene i have been watching her for a 
long time now and i know she is not happy she is so desperately in 
love with you i notice when a letter does not come promptly she is downcast 
and i can't help seeing that she is longing to have you here with her 
eugene why don't you marry angela she is lovely and attractive now and she is 
as good as she is beautiful she doesn't want to wait for a fine house 
and luxuriesno girl wants to do that eugene when she loves as i know angela 
does you she would rather have you now when you are both young and can 
enjoy life than any fine house or nice things you might give her later now 
i haven't talked to her at all eugenenever one wordand i know it would hurt 
her terribly if she thought i had written to you she would never forgive me 
but i can't help it i can't bear to see her grieving and longing and 
i know that when you know you will come and get her don't ever indicate 
in any way please that i wrote to you don't write to me unless you 
want to very much i would rather you didn't and tear up this letter but 
do come for her soon eugene please do she wants you and she will make 
you a perfectly wonderful wife for she is a wonderful girl we all love her 
sopapa and mamma and all i hope you will forgive me i can't help it 
with love i am yours marietta when eugene received this letter he was surprised and 
astonished but also distressed for himself and angela and marietta and the whole situation the 
tragedy of this situation appealed to him perhaps as much from the dramatic as from 
the personal point of view little angela with her yellow hair and classic face what 
a shame that they could not be together as she wished as really in a 
way he wished she was beautifulno doubt of that and there was a charm about 
her which was as alluring as that of any girl barring the intellectually exceptional her 
emotions in a way were deeper than those of miriam finch and christina channing she 
could not reason about themthat was all she just felt them he saw all the 
phases of her anguishthe probable attitude of her parents her own feelings at being looked 
at by them the way her friends wondered it was a shame no doubt of 
thata cruel situation perhaps he had better go back he could be happy with her 
they could live in a studio and no doubt things would work out all right 
had he better be cruel and not go he hated to think of it anyhow 
he did not answer marietta's letter and he did tear it up into a thousand 
bits as she requested if angela knew no doubt she would feel wretched he thought 
in the meanwhile angela was thinking and her brooding led her to the conclusion that 
it might be advisable if ever her lover came back to yield herself in order 
that he might feel compelled to take her she was no reasoner about life in 
any big sense her judgment of affairs was more confused at this time than at 
a later period she had no clear conception of how foolish any trickery of this 
sort would be she loved eugene felt that she must have him felt that she 
would be willing to die rather than lose him and the thought of trickery came 
only as a last resource if he refused her she was determined on one thingthe 
lake she would quit this dreary world where love was crossed with despair in its 
finest moments she would forget it all if only there were rest and silence on 
the other side that would be enough the year moved on toward spring and because 
of some note of this reiterated in pathetic phrases he came to feel that he 
must go back marietta's letter preyed on his mind the intensity of angela's attitude made 
him feel that something desperate would happen he could not in cold blood sit down 
and write her that he would not see her any more the impressions of blackwood 
were too fresh in his mindthe summer incense and green beauty of the world in 
which she lived he wrote in april that he would come again in june and 
angela was beside herself with joy one of the things which helped eugene to this 
conclusion was the fact that christina channing was not coming back from europe that year 
she had written a few times during the winter but very guardedly a casual reader 
could not have drawn from what she said that there had ever been anything between 
them he had written much more ardently of course but she had chosen to ignore 
his eager references making him feel by degrees that he was not to know much 
of her in the future they were going to be good friends but not necessarily 
lovers nor eventually husband and wife it irritated him to think she could be so 
calm about a thing which to him seemed so important it hurt his pride to 
think she could so deliberately throw him over finally he began to be incensed and 
then angela's fidelity appeared in a much finer light there was a girl who would 
not treat him so she really loved him she was faithful and true so his 
promised trip began to look much more attractive and by june he was in a 
fever to see her chapter xxvi the beautiful june weather arrived and with it eugene 
took his departure once more for blackwood he was in a peculiar mood for while 
he was anxious to see angela again it was with the thought that perhaps he 
was making a mistake a notion of fatality was beginning to run through his mind 
perhaps he was destined to take her and yet could anything be more ridiculous he 
could decide he had deliberately decided to go back thereor had he he admitted to 
himself that his passion was drawing himin fact he could not see that there was 
anything much in love outside of passion desire wasn't that all that pulled two people 
together there was some little charm of personality above that but desire was the keynote 
and if the physical attraction were strong enough wasn't that sufficient to hold two people 
together did you really need so much more it was logic based on youth enthusiasm 
and inexperience but it was enough to hold him for the time beingto soothe him 
to angela he was not drawn by any of the things which drew him to 
miriam finch and norma whitmore nor was there the wonderful art of christina channing still 
he was going his interest in norma whitmore had increased greatly as the winter passed 
in this woman he had found an intellect as broadening and refining as any he 
had encountered her taste for the exceptional in literature and art was as great as 
that of anyone he had ever known and it was just as individual she ran 
to impressive realistic fiction in literature and to the kind of freshfromthesoil art which eugene 
represented her sense of just how big and fresh was the thing he was trying 
to do was very encouraging and she was carrying the word about town to all 
her friends that he was doing it she had even gone so far as to 
speak to two different art dealers asking them why they had not looked into what 
seemed to her his perfectly wonderful drawings why they're astonishing in their newness she told 
eberhard zang one of the important picture dealers on fifth avenue she knew him from 
having gone there to borrow pictures for reproduction witla witla he commented in his conservative 
german way rubbing his chin i doand remember seeing anything by him of course you 
don't replied norma persistently he's new i tell you he hasn't been here so very 
long you get truth for some week in last monthi forget which oneand see that 
picture of greeley square it will show you what i mean witla witla repeated zang 
much as a parrot might fix a sound in its memory tell him to come 
in here and see me some day i should like to see some of his 
things i will said norma genially she was anxious to have eugene go but he 
was more anxious to get a lot of things done before he had an exhibition 
he did not want to risk an impression with anything short of a rather extensive 
series and his collection of views was not complete at that time besides he had 
a much more significant art dealer in mind he and norma had reached the point 
by this time where they were like brother and sister or better yet two good 
men friends he would slip his arm about her waist when entering her rooms and 
was free to hold her hands or pat her on the arm or shoulder there 
was nothing more than strong good feeling on his part while on hers a burning 
affection might have been inspired but his genial brotherly attitude convinced her that it was 
useless he had never told her of any of his other women friends and he 
was wondering as he rode west how she and miriam finch would take his marriage 
with angela supposing that he ever did marry her as for christina channing he did 
not want to thinkreally did not dare to think of her very much some sense 
of lost beauty came to him out of that experiencea touch of memory that had 
a pang in it chicago in june was just a little dreary to him with 
its hurry of life its breath of past experience the art institute the daily globe 
building the street and house in which ruby had lived he wondered about her as 
he had before the moment he neared the city and had a strong desire to 
go and look her up then he visited the globe offices but mathews had gone 
genial cheerful jerry had moved to philadelphia recently taking a position on the philadelphia north 
american leaving howe alone more finicky and picayune than ever goldfarb of course was gone 
and eugene felt out of it he was glad to take the train for blackwood 
for he felt lonesome he left the city with quite an ache for old times 
in his heart and the feeling that life was a jumble of meaningless strange and 
pathetic things to think that we should grow old he pondered that things that were 
as real as these things were to me should become mere memories the time just 
before he reached blackwood was one of great emotional stress for angela now she was 
to learn whether he really loved her as much as he had she was to 
feel the joy of his presence the subtle influence of his attitude she was to 
find whether she could hold him or not marietta who on hearing that he was 
coming had rather plumed herself that her letter had had something to do with it 
was afraid that her sister would not make good use of this opportune occasion she 
was anxious that angela should look her best and made suggestions as to things she 
might wear games she might play they had installed tennis and croquet as part of 
the home pleasures since he had been there last and places they might go to 
marietta was convinced that angela was not artful enoughnot sufficiently subtle in her presentation of 
her charms he could be made to feel very keen about her if she dressed 
right and showed herself to the best advantage marietta herself intended to keep out of 
the way as much as possible when eugene arrived and to appear at great disadvantage 
in the matter of dress and appearance when seen for she had become a perfect 
beauty and was a breaker of hearts without conscious effort you know that string of 
coral beads i have angel face she asked angela one morning some ten days before 
eugene arrived wear them with that tan linen dress of mine and your tan shoes 
some day for eugene you'll look stunning in those things and he'll like you why 
don't you take the new buggy and drive over to blackwood to meet him that's 
it you must meet him oh i don't think i want to babyette she replied 
she was afraid of this first impression she did not want to appear to run 
after him babyette was a nickname which had been applied to marietta in childhood and 
had never been dropped oh pshaw angel face don't be so backward you're the shyest 
thing i know why that's nothing he'll like you all the better for treating him 
just a little smartly you do that now will you i can't replied angela i 
can't do it that way let him come over here first then i'll drive him 
over some afternoon oh angel face well anyhow when he comes you must wear that 
little rose flowered house dress and put a wreath of green leaves in your hair 
oh i won't do anything of the sort babyette exclaimed angela yes you will replied 
her sister now you just have to do what i tell you for once that 
dress looks beautiful on you and the wreath will make it perfect it isn't the 
dress i know that's nice it's the wreath marietta was incensed by this bit of 
pointless reserve oh angela she exclaimed don't be so silly you're older than i am 
but i know more about men in a minute than you'll ever know don't you 
want him to like you you'll have to be more daringgoodness lots of girls would 
go a lot farther than that she caught her sister about the waist and looked 
into her eyes now you've got to wear it she added finally and angela understood 
that marietta wanted her to entice eugene by any means in her power to make 
him declare himself finally and set a definite date or take her back to new 
york with him there were other conversations in which a trip to the lake was 
suggested games of tennis with angela wearing her white tennis suit and shoes a country 
dance which might be got upthere were rumors of one to be given in the 
new barn of a farmer some seven miles away marietta was determined that angela should 
appear youthful gay active just the things which she knew instinctively would fascinate eugene finally 
eugene came he arrived at blackwood at noon despite her objections angela met him dressed 
smartly and as urged by marietta carrying herself with an air she hoped to impress 
eugene with a sense of independence but when she saw him stepping down from the 
train in belted corduroy travelling suit with a grey english travelling cap carrying a green 
leather bag of the latest design her heart misgave her he was so worldly now 
so experienced you could see by his manner that this country place meant little or 
nothing to him he had tasted of the world at large angela had stayed in 
her buggy at the end of the depot platform and she soon caught eugene's eye 
and waved to him he came briskly forward why sweet he exclaimed here you are 
how nice you look he jumped up beside her surveying her critically and she could 
feel his examining glance after the first pleasant impression he sensed the difference between his 
new world and hers and was a little depressed by it she was a little 
older no doubt of that you cannot hope and yearn and worry for three years 
and not show it and yet she was fine and tender and sympathetic and emotional 
he felt all this it hurt him a little for her sake and his too 
well how have you been he asked they were in the confines of the village 
and no demonstration could be made until the quiet of a country road could be 
reached all had to be formal oh just the same eugene longing to see you 
she looked into his eyes and he felt the impact of that emotional force which 
governed her when she was near him there was something in the chemistry of her 
being which roused to blazing the ordinarily dormant forces of his sympathies she tried to 
conceal her real feelingto pretend gaiety and enthusiasm but her eyes betrayed her something roused 
in him now at her looka combined sense of emotion and desire it's so fine 
to be out in the country again he said pressing her hand for he was 
letting her drive after the city to see you and the green fields he looked 
about at the little onestorey cottages each with a small plot of grass a few 
trees a neat confining fence after new york and chicago a village like this was 
quaint do you love me just as much as ever she nodded her head they 
reached a strip of yellow road he asking after her father her mother her brothers 
and sisters and when he saw that they were unobserved he slipped his arm about 
her and drew her head to him now we can he said she felt the 
force of his desire but she missed that note of adoration which had seemed to 
characterize his first lovemaking how true it was he had changed he must have the 
city had made her seem less significant it hurt her to think that life should 
treat her so but perhaps she could win him backcould hold him anyhow they drove 
over toward okoonee a little crossroads settlement near a small lake of the same name 
a place which was close to the blue house and which the blue's were wont 
to speak of as home on the way eugene learned that her youngest brother david 
was a cadet at west point now and doing splendidly samuel had become western freight 
agent of the great northern and was on the way to desirable promotion benjamin had 
completed his law studies and was practising in racine he was interested in politics and 
was going to run for the state legislature marietta was still the gay carefree girl 
she had always been not at all inclined to choose yet among her many anxious 
suitors eugene thought of her letter to himwondered if she would look her thoughts into 
his eyes when he saw her oh marietta angela replied when eugene asked after her 
she's just as dangerous as ever she makes all the men make love to her 
eugene smiled marietta was always a pleasing thought to him he wished for the moment 
that it was marietta instead of angela that he was coming to see she was 
as shrewd as she was kind in this instance her appearance on meeting eugene was 
purposely indifferent and her attitude anything but coaxing and gay at the same time she 
suffered a genuine pang of feeling for eugene appealed to her if it were anybody 
but angela she thought how she would dress and how quickly she would be coquetting 
with him then his love would be won by her and she felt that she 
could hold it she had great confidence in her ability to keep any man and 
eugene was a man she would have delighted to hold as it was she kept 
out of his way took sly glances at him here and there wondered if angela 
would truly win him she was so anxious for angela's sake never never she told 
herself would she cross her sister's path at the blue homestead he was received as 
cordially as before after an hour it quite brought back the feeling of three years 
before these open fields this old house and its lovely lawn all served to awaken 
the most poignant sensations one of marietta's beaux over from waukesha appeared after eugene had 
greeted mrs blue and marietta and the latter persuaded him to play a game of 
tennis with angela she invited eugene to make it a four with her but not 
knowing how he refused angela changed to her tennis suit and eugene opened his eyes 
to her charms she was very attractive on the court quick flushed laughing and when 
she laughed she had a charming way of showing her even small white teeth she 
quite awakened a feeling of interestshe looked so dainty and frail when he saw her 
afterward in the dark quiet parlor he gathered her to his heart with much of 
the old ardour she felt the quick change of feeling marietta was right eugene loved 
gaiety and color although on the way home she had despaired this was much more 
promising eugene rarely entered on anything half heartedly if interested at all he was greatly 
interested he could so yield himself to the glamour of a situation as to come 
finally to believe that he was something which he was not thus now he was 
beginning to accept this situation as angela and marietta wished he should and to see 
her in somewhat the old light he overlooked things which in his new york studio 
surrounded by the influences which there modified his judgment he would have seen angela was 
not young enough for him she was not liberal in her views she was charming 
no doubt of that but he could not bring her to an understanding of his 
casual acceptance of life she knew nothing of his real disposition and he did not 
tell her he played the part of a seemingly singleminded romeo and as such he 
was from a woman's point of view beautiful to contemplate in his own mind he 
was coming to see that he was fickle but he still did not want to 
admit it to himself there was a night of stars after an evening of june 
perfection at five old jotham came in from the fields as dignified and patriarchal as 
ever he greeted eugene with a hearty handshake for he admired him i see some 
of your work now and then he said in these monthly magazines it's fine there's 
a young minister down here near the lake that's very anxious to meet you he 
likes to get hold of anything you do and i always send the books down 
as soon as angela gets through with them he used the words books and magazines 
interchangeably and spoke as though they were not much more important to him than the 
leaves of the trees as indeed they were not to a mind used to contemplating 
the succession of crops and seasons all life with its multitudinous interplay of shapes and 
forms seemed passing shadows even men were like leaves that fall eugene was drawn to 
old jotham as a filing to a magnet his was just the type of mind 
that appealed to him and angela gained by the radiated glory of her father if 
he was so wonderful she must be something above the average of womanhood such a 
man could not help but produce exceptional children left alone together it was hardly possible 
for angela and eugene not to renew the old relationship on the old basis having 
gone as far as he had the first time it was natural that he should 
wish to go as far again and further after dinner when she turned to him 
from her room arrayed in a soft evening dress of clinging texturesomewhat low in the 
neck by request of marietta who had helped her to dresseugene was conscious of her 
emotional perturbation he himself was distraught for he did not know what he would dohow 
far he would dare to trust himself he was always troubled when dealing with his 
physical passion for it was a raging lion at times it seemed to overcome him 
quite as a drug might or a soporific fume he would mentally resolve to control 
himself but unless he instantly fled there was no hope and he did not seem 
able to run away he would linger and parley and in a few moments it 
was master and he was following its behest blindly desperately to the point almost of 
exposure and destruction tonight when angela came back he was cogitating wondering what it might 
mean should he would he marry her could he escape they sat down to talk 
but presently he drew her to him it was the old storymoment after moment of 
increasing feeling presently she from the excess of longing and waiting was lost to all 
sense of consideration and he i shall have to go away eugene she pleaded when 
he carried her recklessly into his room if anything happens i cannot stay here don't 
talk he said you can come to me you mean it eugene surely she begged 
as sure as i'm holding you here he replied at midnight angela lifted frightened wondering 
doubting eyes feeling herself the most depraved creature two pictures were in her mind alternately 
and with pendulumlike reiteration one was a composite of a marriage altar and a charming 
new york studio with friends coming in to see them much as he had often 
described to her the other was of the still blue waters of okoonee with herself 
lying there pale and still yes she would die if he did not marry her 
now life would not be worth while she would not force him she would slip 
out some night when it was too late and all hope had been abandonedwhen exposure 
was nearand the next day they would find her little marietta how she would cry 
and old jothamshe could see him but he would never be really sure of the 
truth and her mother oh god in heaven she thought how hard life is how 
terrible it can be chapter xxvii the atmosphere of the house after this night seemed 
charged with reproach to eugene although it took on no semblance of reality in either 
look or word when he awoke in the morning and looked through the half closed 
shutters to the green world outside he felt a sense of freshness and of shame 
it was cruel to come into such a home as this and do a thing 
as mean as he had done after all philosophy or no philosophy didn't a fine 
old citizen like jotham honest upright genuine in his moral point of view and his 
observance of the golden rule didn't he deserve better from a man whom he so 
sincerely admired jotham had been so nice to him their conversations together were so kindly 
and sympathetic eugene felt that jotham believed him to be an honest man he knew 
he had that appearance he was frank genial considerate not willing to condemn anyonebut this 
sex questionthat was where he was weak and was not the whole world keyed to 
that did not the decencies and the sanities of life depend on right moral conduct 
was not the world dependent on how the homes were run how could anyone be 
good if his mother and father had not been good before him how could the 
children of the world expect to be anything if people rushed here and there holding 
illicit relations take his sister myrtle nowwould he have wanted her rifled in this manner 
in the face of this question he was not ready to say exactly what he 
wanted or was willing to countenance myrtle was a free agent as was every other 
girl she could do as she pleased it might not please him exactly buthe went 
round and round from one problem to another trying to untie this gordian knot one 
thing this home had appeared sweet and clean when he came into it now it 
was just a little tarnished and by him or was it his mind was always 
asking this question there was nothing that he was actually accepting as true any more 
he was going round in a ring asking questions of this proposition and that are 
you true and are you true and are you true and all the while he 
was apparently not getting anywhere it puzzled him this life sometimes it shamed him this 
deed shamed him and he asked himself whether he was wrong to be ashamed or 
not perhaps he was just foolish was not life made for living not worrying he 
had not created his passions and desires he threw open the shutters and there was 
the bright day everything was so green outside the flowers in bloom the trees casting 
a cool lovely shade the birds twittering bees were humming he could smell the lilacs 
dear god he exclaimed throwing his arms above his head how lovely life is how 
beautiful oh he drew in a deep breath of the flower and privet laden air 
if only he could live always like thisfor ever and ever when he had sponged 
himself with cold water and dressed putting on a soft negligée shirt with turndown collar 
and dark flowing tie he issued forth clean and fresh angela was there to greet 
him her face was pale but she looked intensely sweet because of her sadness there 
there he said touching her chin less of that now i told them that i 
had a headache she said so i have do you understand i understand your headache 
he laughed but everything is all rightvery much all right isn't this a lovely day 
beautiful replied angela sadly cheer up he insisted don't worry everything is coming out fine 
he walked to the window and stared out i'll have your breakfast ready in a 
minute she said and pressing his hand left him eugene went out to the hammock 
he was so deliciously contented and joyous now that he saw the green world about 
him that he felt that everything was all right again the vigorous blooming forces of 
nature everywhere present belied the sense of evil and decay to which mortality is so 
readily subject he felt that everything was justified in youth and love particularly where mutual 
affection reigned why should he not take angela why should they not be together he 
went in to breakfast at her call eating comfortably of the things she provided he 
felt the easy familiarity and graciousness of the conqueror angela on her part felt the 
fear and uncertainty of one who has embarked upon a dangerous voyage she had set 
sailwhither at what port would she land was it the lake or his studio would 
she live and be happy or would she die to face a black uncertainty was 
there a hell as some preachers insisted was there a gloomy place of lost souls 
such as the poets described she looked into the face of this same world which 
eugene found so beautiful and its very beauty trembled with forebodings of danger and there 
were days and days yet to be lived of this for all her fear once 
having tasted of the forbidden fruit it was sweet and inviting she could not go 
near eugene nor he near her but this flush of emotion would return in the 
daylight she was too fearful but when the night came with its stars its fresh 
winds its urge to desire her fears could not stand in their way eugene was 
insatiable and she was yearning the slightest touch was as fire to tow she yielded 
saying she would not yield the blue family were of course blissfully ignorant of what 
was happening it seemed so astonishing to angela at first that the very air did 
not register her actions in some visible way that they should be able thus to 
be alone was not so remarkable seeing that eugene's courtship was being aided and abetted 
for her sake but that her lapse should not be exposed by some sinister influence 
seemed strangeaccidental and subtly ominous something would happenthat was her fear she had not the 
courage of her desire or need by the end of the week though eugene was 
less ardent and more or less oppressed by the seeming completeness with which he had 
conquered he was not ready to leave he was sorry to go for it ended 
a honeymoon of sweetness and beautyall the more wonderful and enchanting because so clandestineyet he 
was beginning to be aware that he had bound himself in chains of duty and 
responsibility angela had thrown herself on his mercy and his sense of honor to begin 
with she had exacted a promise of marriagenot urgently and as one who sought to 
entrap him but with the explanation that otherwise life must end in disaster for her 
eugene could look in her face and see that it would and now that he 
had had his way and plumbed the depths of her emotions and desires he had 
a higher estimate of her personality despite the fact that she was older than he 
there was a breath of youth and beauty here that held him her body was 
exquisite her feeling about life and love was tender and beautiful he wished he could 
make true her dreams of bliss without injury to himself it so turned out that 
as his visit was drawing to a close angela decided that she ought to go 
to chicago for there were purchases which must be made her mother wanted her to 
go and she decided that she would go with eugene this made the separation easier 
gave them more time to talk her usual plan was to stay with her aunt 
and she was going there now on the way she asked over and over what 
he would think of her in the future whether what had passed would not lower 
her in his eyes he did not feel that it would once she said to 
him sadlyonly death or marriage can help me now what do you mean he asked 
her yellow head pillowed on his shoulder her dark blue eyes looking sadly into his 
that if you don't marry me i'll have to kill myself i can't stay at 
home he thought of her with her beautiful body her mass of soft hair all 
tarnished in death you wouldn't do that he asked unbelievingly yes i would she said 
sadly i must i will hush angel face he pleaded you won't do anything like 
that you won't have to i'll marry youhow would you do it oh i've thought 
it all out she continued gloomily you know that little lake i'd drown myself don't 
sweetheart he pleaded don't talk that way it's terrible you won't have to do anything 
like that to think of her under the waters of little okoonee with its green 
banks and yellow sandy shores all her love come to this all her passion her 
death would be upon his head and he could not stand the thought of that 
it frightened him such tragedies occasionally appeared in the papers with all the pathetic details 
convincingly set forth but this should not enter his life he would marry her she 
was lovely after all he would have to he might as well make up his 
mind to that now he began to speculate how soon it might be for the 
sake of her family she wanted no secret marriage but one which if they could 
not be present at it they could at least know was taking place she was 
willing to come eastthat could be arranged but they must be married eugene realized the 
depth of her conventional feeling so keenly that it never occurred to him to suggest 
an alternative she would not consent would scorn him for it the only alternative she 
appeared to believe was death one eveningthe lastwhen it was necessary for her to return 
to blackwood and he had seen her off on the train her face a study 
in sadness he rode out gloomily to jackson park where he had once seen a 
beautiful lake in the moonlight when he reached there the waters of the lake were 
still suffused and tinged with lovely suggestions of lavender pink and silver for this was 
near the twentyfirst of june the trees to the east and west were dark the 
sky showed a last blush of orange odours were aboutwarm june fragrance he thought now 
as he walked about the quiet paths where the sand and pebbles crunched lightly beneath 
his feet of all the glory of this wonderful week how dramatic was life how 
full of romance this love of angela's how beautiful youth was with himlove would he 
go on to greater days of beauty or would he stumble idling his time wasting 
his substance in riotous living was this riotous living would there be evil fruition of 
his deeds would he really love angela after he married her would they be happy 
thus he stood by the bank of this still lake studying the water marvelling at 
the subtleties of reflected radiance feeling the artist's joy in perfect natural beauty twining and 
intertwining it all with love death failure fame it was romantic to think that in 
such a lake if he were unkind would angela be found by such a dark 
as was now descending would all her bright dreams be submerged it would be beautiful 
as romance he could imagine a great artist like daudet or balzac making a great 
story out of it it was even a subject for some form of romantic expression 
in art poor angela if he were a great portrait painter he would paint her 
he thought of some treatment of her in the nude with that mass of hair 
of hers falling about her neck and breasts it would be beautiful should he marry 
her yes though he was not sure of the outcome he must it might be 
a mistake but he stared at the fading surface of the lake silver lavender leaden 
gray overhead a vivid star was already shining how would it be with her if 
she were really below those still waters how would it be with him it would 
be too desperate too regretful no he must marry her it was in this mood 
that he returned to the city the ache of life in his heart it was 
in this mood that he secured his grip from the hotel and sought the midnight 
train for new york for once ruby miriam christina were forgotten he was involved in 
a love drama which meant life or death to angela peace or reproach of conscience 
to himself in the future he could not guess what the outcome would be but 
he felt that he must marry herhow soon he could not say circumstances would dictate 
that from present appearances it must be immediately he must see about a studio announce 
the news of his departure to smite and machugh make a special effort to further 
his art ambitions so that he and angela would have enough to live on he 
had talked so glowingly of his art life that now when the necessity for demonstrating 
it was at hand he was troubled as to what the showing might be the 
studio had to be attractive he would need to introduce his friends all the way 
back to new york he turned this over in his mindsmite machugh miriam norma wheeler 
christinawhat would christina think if she ever returned to new york and found him married 
there was no question but that there was a difference between angela and these it 
was somethinga matter of couragemore soul more daring more awareness perhapssomething when they saw her 
would they think he had made a mistake would they put him down as a 
fool machugh was going with a girl but she was a different typeintellectual smart he 
thought and thought but he came back to the same conclusion always he would have 
to marry her there was no way out he would have to chapter xxviii the 
studio of messrs smite machugh and witla in waverley place was concerned the following october 
with a rather picturesque event even in the city the time when the leaves begin 
to yellow and fall brings a sense of melancholy augmented by those preliminaries of winter 
gray lowery days with scraps of paper straws bits of wood blown about by gusty 
currents of air through the streets making it almost disagreeable to be abroad the fear 
of cold and storm and suffering among those who have little was already apparent apparent 
too was the air of renewed vitality common to those who have spent an idle 
summer and are anxious to work again shopping and marketing and barter and sale were 
at high key the art world the social world the manufacturing world the professional worlds 
of law medicine finance literature were bubbling with a feeling of the necessity to do 
and achieve the whole city stung by the apprehension of winter had an atmosphere of 
emprise and energy in this atmosphere with a fairly clear comprehension of the elements which 
were at work making the colour of the life about him was eugene digging away 
at the task he had set himself since leaving angela he had come to the 
conclusion that he must complete the jointings for the exhibition which had been running in 
his mind during the last two years there was no other way for him to 
make a notable impressionhe saw that since he had returned he had gone through various 
experiences: the experience of having angela tell him that she was sure there was something 
wrong with her an impression sincere enough but based on an excited and overwrought imagination 
of evil to follow and having no foundation in fact eugene was as yet despite 
his several experiences not sufficiently informed in such affairs to know his lack of courage 
would have delayed him from asking if he had known in the next place facing 
this crisis he had declared that he would marry her and because of her distressed 
condition he thought he might as well do it now he had wanted time to 
do some of the pictures he was working on to take in a little money 
for drawing to find a suitable place to live in he had looked at various 
studios in various sections of the city and had found nothing as yet which answered 
to his taste or his purse anything with a proper light a bath a suitable 
sleeping room and an inconspicuous chamber which might be turned into a kitchen was difficult 
to find prices were high ranging from fifty to one hundred and twentyfive and one 
hundred and fifty a month there were some new studios being erected for the rich 
loungers and idlers which commanded so he understood three or four thousand dollars a year 
he wondered if he should ever attain to any such magnificence through his art again 
in taking a studio for angela and himself there was the matter of furniture the 
studio he had with smite and machugh was more or less of a camp the 
work room was bare of carpets or rugs the two folding beds and the cot 
which graced their individual chambers were heirlooms from ancient predecessorssubstantial but shabby beyond various drawings 
three easels and a chest of drawers for each there was no suitable household equipment 
a woman came twice a week to clean send out the linen and make up 
the beds to live with angela required in his judgment many and much more significant 
things his idea of a studio was some such one as that now occupied by 
miriam finch or norma whitmore there ought to be furniture of a periodold flemish or 
colonial heppelwhite or chippendale or sheraton such as he saw occasionally knocking about in curio 
shops and second hand stores it could be picked up if he had time he 
was satisfied that angela knew nothing of these things there ought to be rugs hangings 
of tapestry bits of brass pewter copper old silver if he could afford it he 
had an idea of some day obtaining a figure of the christ in brass or 
plaster hung upon a rough cross of walnut or teak which he could hang or 
stand in some corner as one might a shrine and place before it two great 
candlesticks with immense candles smoked and dripping with wax these lighted in a dark studio 
with the outlines of the christ flickering in the shadows behind would give the desired 
atmosphere to his studio such an equipment as he dreamed of would have cost in 
the neighborhood of two thousand dollars of course this was not to be thought of 
at this period he had no more than that in ready cash he was writing 
to angela about his difficulties in finding a suitable place when he heard of a 
studio in washington square south which its literary possessor was going to quit for the 
winter it was so he understood handsomely furnished and was to be let for the 
rent of the studio the owner wanted someone who would take care of it by 
occupying it for him until he should return the following fall eugene hurried round to 
look at it and taken with the location the appearance of the square from the 
windows the beauty of the furnishings felt that he would like to live here this 
would be the way to introduce angela to new york this would be the first 
and proper impression to give her here as in every well arranged studio he had 
yet seen were books pictures bits of statuary implements of copper and some few of 
silver there was a great fish net dyed green and spangled with small bits of 
mirror to look like scales which hung as a veil between the studio proper and 
an alcove there was a piano done in black walnut and odd pieces of furniture 
mission flemish venetian of the sixteenth century and english of the seventeenth which despite that 
diversity offered a unity of appearance and a harmony of usefulness there was one bed 
room a bath and a small partitioned section which could be used as a kitchen 
with a few of his pictures judiciously substituted he could see a perfect abode here 
for himself and his wife the rent was fifty dollars he decided that he would 
risk it having gone so far as to indicate that he would take ithe was 
made to feel partially resigned to marriage by the very appearance of this placehe decided 
that he would marry in october angela could come to new york or buffaloshe had 
never seen niagara fallsand they could be married there she had spoken recently of visiting 
her brother at west point then they could come here and settle down he decided 
that this must be so wrote to her to that effect and vaguely hinted to 
smite and machugh that he might get married shortly this was a great blow to 
his partners in art for eugene was very popular with them he had the habit 
with those he liked of jesting constantly look at the look of noble determination on 
smite's brow this morning he would comment cheerfully on getting up or machugh you lazy 
lout crawl out and earn your living machugh's nose eyes and ears would be comfortably 
buried in the folds of a blanket these hack artists eugene would sigh disconsolately there's 
not much to be made out of them a pile of straw and a couple 
of boiled potatoes a day is all they need aw cut it out machugh would 
grunt to hell to hell i yell i yell would come from somewhere in the 
voice of smite if it weren't for me eugene would go on god knows what 
would become of this place a lot of farmers and fishermen trying to be artists 
and laundry wagon drivers don't forget that machugh would add sitting up and rubbing his 
tousled head for eugene had related some of his experiences don't forget the contribution made 
by the american steam laundry company to the world of true art collars and cuffs 
i would have you know is artistic eugene at once declared with mock dignity whereas 
plows and fish is trash sometimes this kidding would continue for a quarter of an 
hour at a stretch when some one remark really brighter than any other would dissolve 
the whole in laughter work began after breakfast to which they usually sallied forth together 
and would continue unbroken save for necessary engagements or periods of entertainment lunch and so 
on until five in the afternoon they had worked together now for a couple of 
years they had by experience learned of each other's reliability courtesy kindness and liberality criticism 
was free generous and sincerely intended to be helpful pleasure trips such as walks on 
grey lowery days or in rain or brilliant sunshine or trips to coney island far 
rockaway the theatres the art exhibitions the odd and peculiar restaurants of different nationalities were 
always undertaken in a spirit of joyous camaraderie jesting as to morality their respective abilities 
their tendencies and characteristics were all taken and given in good part at one time 
it would be joseph smite who would come in for a united drubbing and excoriation 
on the part of eugene and machugh at another time eugene or machugh would be 
the victim the other two joining forces vigorously art literature personalities phases of life philosophy 
were discussed by turn as with jerry mathews eugene had learned of new things from 
these menthe life of fisherfolk and the characteristics of the ocean from joseph smite the 
nature and spirit of the great west from machugh each appeared to have an inexhaustible 
fund of experiences and reminiscences which refreshed and entertained the trio day by day year 
in and year out they were at their best strolling through some exhibit or preliminary 
view of an art collection offered for sale when all their inmost convictions of what 
was valuable and enduring in art would come to the surface all three were intolerant 
of reputations as such but were strong for individual merit whether it carried a great 
name or not they were constantly becoming acquainted with the work of some genius little 
known here and celebrating his talents each to the others thus monet degas manet ribera 
monticelli by turns came up for examination and praise when eugene then toward the end 
of september announced that he might be leaving them shortly there was a united wail 
of opposition joseph smite was working on a sea scene at the time doing his 
best to get the proper colour harmony between the wormeaten deck of a gold coast 
trading ship a half naked west coast negro handling a broken wheel and a mass 
of blue black undulations in the distance which represented the boundless sea g'wan said smite 
incredulously for he assumed that eugene was jesting there had been a steady stream of 
letters issuing from somewhere in the west and delivered here week after week as there 
had been for machugh but this by now was a commonplace and apparently meant nothing 
you marry what the hell do you want to get married for a fine specimen 
you will make i'll come around and tell your wife sure returned eugene it's true 
i may get married he was amused at smite's natural assumption that it was a 
jest stow that called machugh from his easel he was working on a country corner 
picture a group of farmers before a country post office you don't want to break 
up this shack do you both of these men were fond of eugene they found 
him inspiring helpful always intensely vigorous and apparently optimistic i don't want to break up 
any shack but haven't i a right to get married i vote no by god 
said smite emphatically you'll never go out of here with my consent peter are we 
going to stand for anything like that we are not replied machugh we'll call out 
the reserves if he tries any game like that on us i'll prefer charges against 
him who's the lady eugene i bet i know suggested smite he's been running up 
to twentysixth street pretty regularly joseph was thinking of miriam finch to whom eugene had 
introduced both him and machugh nothing like that surely inquired machugh looking over at eugene 
to see if it possibly could be so it's all true fellers replied eugene as 
god is my judge i'm going to leave you soon you're not really talking seriously 
are you witla inquired joseph soberly i am joe said eugene quietly he was studying 
the perspective of his sixteenth new york viewthree engines coming abreast into a great yard 
of cars the smoke the haze the dingy reds and blues and yellows and greens 
of kicked about box cars were showing with beautythe vigor and beauty of raw reality 
soon asked machugh equally quietly he was feeling that touch of pensiveness which comes with 
a sense of vanishing pleasures i think some time in october very likely replied eugene 
jesus christ i'm sorry to hear that put in smite he laid down his brush 
and strolled over to the window machugh less expressive in extremes worked on medatively when'd 
you reach that conclusion witla he asked after a time oh i've been thinking it 
over for a long time peter he returned i should really have married before if 
i could have afforded it i know how things are here or i wouldn't have 
sprung this so suddenly i'll hold up my end on the rent here until you 
get someone else to hell with the rent said smite we don't want anyone else 
do we peter we didn't have anyone else before smite was rubbing his square chin 
and contemplating his partner as if they were facing a catastrophe there's no use talking 
about that said peter you know we don't care about the rent do you mind 
telling us who you're going to marry do we know her you don't returned eugene 
she's out in wisconsin it's the one who writes the letters angela blue is her 
name well here's to angela blue by god say i said smite recovering his spirits 
and picking up his paint brush from his board to hold aloft here's to mrs 
eugene witla and may she never reef a sail to a storm or foul an 
anchor as they say up nova scotia way right oh added machugh catching the spirit 
of smite's generous attitude them's my sentiments when d'you expect to get married really eugene 
oh i haven't fixed the time exactly about november first i should say i hope 
you won't say anything about it though either of you i don't want to go 
through any explanations we won't but it's tough you old walrus why the hell didn't 
you give us time to think it over you're a fine jellyfish you are he 
poked him reprimandingly in the ribs there isn't anyone any more sorry than i am 
said eugene i hate to leave here i do but we won't lose track of 
each other i'll still be around here where do you expect to live here in 
the city asked machugh still a little gloomy sure right here in washington square remember 
that dexter studio weaver was telling about the one in the third floor at sixtyone 
that's it you don't say exclaimed smite you're in right how'd you get that eugene 
explained well you sure are a lucky man observed machugh your wife ought to like 
that i suppose there'll be a cozy corner for an occasional strolling artist no farmers 
no seafaring men no artistic hacksnothing declared eugene dramatically you to hell said smite when 
mrs witla sees us she'll wish she'd never come to new york put in eugene 
she'll wish she'd seen us first said machugh book ii the struggle chapter i the 
marriage ceremony between eugene and angela was solemnized at buffalo on november second as planned 
marietta was with them they would go the three of them to the falls and 
to west point where the girls would see their brother david and then marietta would 
return to tell the family about it naturally under the circumstances it was a very 
simple affair for there were no congratulations to go through with and no giftsat least 
immediatelyto consider and acknowledge angela had explained to her parents and friends that it was 
quite impossible for eugene to come west at this time she knew that he objected 
to a public ceremony where he would have to run the gauntlet of all her 
relatives and so she was quite willing to meet him in the east and be 
married there eugene had not troubled to take his family into his confidence as yet 
he had indicated on his last visit home that he might get married and that 
angela was the girl in question but since myrtle was the only one of his 
family who had seen her and she was now in ottumwa iowa they could not 
recall anything about her eugene's father was a little disappointed for he expected to hear 
some day that eugene had made a brilliant match his boy whose pictures were in 
the magazines so frequently and whose appearance was so generally distinguished ought in new york 
where opportunities abounded to marry an heiress at least it was all right of course 
if eugene wanted to marry a girl from the country but it robbed the family 
of a possible glory the spirit of this marriage celebration so far as eugene was 
concerned was hardly right there was the consciousness always with him of his possibly making 
a mistake the feeling that he was being compelled by circumstances and his own weakness 
to fulfil an agreement which might better remain unfulfilled his only urge was his desire 
in the gratification of which he might find compensation for saving angela from an unhappy 
spinsterhood it was a thin reed to lean on there could be no honest satisfaction 
in it angela was sweet devoted painstaking in her attitude toward life toward him toward 
everything with which she came in contact but she was not what he had always 
fancied his true mate would bethe be all and the end all of his existence 
where was the divine fire which on this occasion should have animated him the lofty 
thoughts of future companionship that intense feeling he had first felt about her when he 
had called on her at her aunt's house in chicago something had happened was it 
that he had cheapened his ideal by too close contact with it had he taken 
a beautiful flower and trailed it in the dust was passion all there was to 
marriage or was it that true marriage was something highera union of fine thoughts and 
feelings did angela share his with him angela did have exalted feelings and moods at 
times they were not sensibly intellectualbut she seemed to respond to the better things in 
music and to some extent in literature she knew nothing about art but she was 
emotionally responsive to many fine things why was not this enough to make life durable 
and comfortable between them was it not really enough after he had gone over all 
these points there was still the thought that there was something wrong in this union 
despite his supposedly laudable conduct in fulfilling an obligation which in a way he had 
helped create or created he was not happy he went to his marriage as a 
man goes to fulfil an uncomfortable social obligation it might turn out that he would 
have an enjoyable and happy life and it might turn out very much otherwise he 
could not face the weight and significance of the social theory that this was for 
lifethat if he married her today he would have to live with her all the 
rest of his days he knew that was the generally accepted interpretation of marriage but 
it did not appeal to him union ought in his estimation to be based on 
a keen desire to live together and on nothing else he did not feel the 
obligation which attaches to children for he had never had any and did not feel 
the desire for any a child was a kind of a nuisance marriage was a 
trick of nature's by which you were compelled to carry out her scheme of race 
continuance love was a lure desire a scheme of propagation devised by the way nature 
the race spirit used you as you would use a workhorse to pull a load 
the load in this case was race progress and man was the victim he did 
not think he owed anything to nature or to this race spirit he had not 
asked to come here he had not been treated as generously as he might have 
been since he arrived why should he do what nature bid when he met angela 
he kissed her fondly for of course the sight of her aroused the feeling of 
desire which had been running in his mind so keenly for some time since last 
seeing angela he had touched no woman principally because the right one had not presented 
herself and because the memories and the anticipations in connection with angela were so close 
now that he was with her again the old fire came over him and he 
was eager for the completion of the ceremony he had seen to the marriage license 
in the morningand from the train on which angela and marietta arrived they proceeded in 
a carriage direct to the methodist preacher the ceremony which meant so much to angela 
meant practically nothing to him it seemed a silly formulathis piece of paper from the 
marriage clerk's office and this instructed phraseology concerning love honor and cherish certainly he would 
love honor and cherish if it were possibleif not then not angela with the marriage 
ring on her finger and the words with this ring i thee wed echoing in 
her ears felt that all her dreams had come true now she was really truly 
mrs eugene witla she did not need to worry about drowning herself or being disgraced 
or enduring a lonely commiserated old age she was the wife of an artista rising 
one and she was going to live in new york what a future stretched before 
her eugene loved her after all she imagined she could see that his slowness in 
marrying her was due to the difficulty of establishing himself properly otherwise he would have 
done it before they drove to the iroquois hotel and registered as man and wife 
securing a separate room for marietta the latter pretending an urgent desire to bathe after 
her railroad journey left them promising to be ready in time for dinner eugene and 
angela were finally alone he now saw how in spite of his fine theories his 
previous experiences with angela had deadened to an extent his joy in this occasion he 
had her again it was true his desire that he had thought of so keenly 
was to be gratified but there was no mystery connected with it his real nuptials 
had been celebrated at blackwood months before this was the commonplace of any marriage relation 
it was intense and gratifying but the original wonderful mystery of unexplored character was absent 
he eagerly took her in his arms but there was more of crude desire than 
of awed delight in the whole proceeding nevertheless angela was sweet to him hers was 
a loving disposition and eugene was the be all and end all of her love 
his figure was of heroic proportions to her his talent was divine fire no one 
could know as much as eugene of course no one could be as artistic true 
he was not as practical as some menher brothers and brothersinlaw for instancebut he was 
a man of genius why should he be practical she was beginning to think already 
of how thoroughly she would help him shape his life toward successwhat a good wife 
she would be to him her training as a teacher her experience as a buyer 
her practical judgment would help him so much they spent the two hours before dinner 
in renewed transports and then dressed and made their public appearance angela had had designed 
a number of dresses for this occasion representing the saving of years and tonight at 
dinner she looked exceptionally pretty in a dress of black silk with neck piece and 
half sleeves of motherofpearl silk set off with a decoration of seed pearls and black 
beads in set designs marietta in a pale pink silk of peachblow softness of hue 
with short sleeves and a low cut bodice was with all her youth and natural 
plumpness and gaiety of soul ravishing now that she had angela safely married she was 
under no obligations to keep out of eugene's way nor to modify her charms in 
order that her sister's might shine she was particularly ebullient in her mood and eugene 
could not help contrasting even in this hour the qualities of the two sisters marietta's 
smile her humor her unconscious courage contrasted so markedly with angela's quietness the luxuries of 
the modern hotel have become the commonplaces of ordinary existence but to the girls they 
were still strange enough to be impressive to angela they were a foretaste of what 
was to be an enduring higher life these carpets hangings elevators waiters seemed in their 
shabby materialism to speak of superior things one day in buffalo with a view of 
the magnificent falls at niagara and then came west point with a dress parade accidentally 
provided for a visiting general and a ball for the cadets marietta because of her 
charm and her brother's popularity found herself so much in demand at west point that 
she extended her stay to a week leaving eugene and angela free to come to 
new york together and have a little time to themselves they only stayed long enough 
to see marietta safely housed and then came to the city and the apartment in 
washington square it was dark when they arrived and angela was impressed with the glittering 
galaxy of lights the city presented across the north river from fortysecond street she had 
no idea of the nature of the city but as the cab at eugene's request 
turned into broadway at fortysecond street and clattered with interrupted progress south to fifth avenue 
she had her first glimpse of that tawdry world which subsequently became known as the 
great white way already its makebelieve and inherent cheapness had come to seem to eugene 
largely characteristic of the city and of life but it still retained enough of the 
lure of the flesh and of clothes and of rushlight reputations to hold his attention 
here were dramatic critics and noted actors and actresses and chorus girls the gods and 
toys of avid inexperienced unsatisfied wealth he showed angela the different theatres called her attention 
to distinguished names made much of restaurants and hotels and shops and stores that sell 
trifles and trash and finally turned into lower fifth avenue where the dignity of great 
houses and great conservative wealth still lingered at fourteenth street angela could already see washington 
arch glowing cream white in the glare of electric lights what is that she asked 
interestedly it's washington arch he replied we live in sight of that on the south 
side of the square oh but it is beautiful she exclaimed it seemed very wonderful 
to her and as they passed under it and the whole square spread out before 
her it seemed a perfect world in which to live is this where it is 
she asked as they stopped in front of the studio building yes this is it 
how do you like it i think it's beautiful she said they went up the 
white stone steps of the old bride house in which was eugene's leased studio up 
two flights of redcarpeted stairs and finally into the dark studio where he struck a 
match and lit for the art of it candles a soft waxen glow irradiated the 
place as he proceeded and then angela saw old chippendale chairs a heppelwhite writingtable a 
flemish strong box containing used and unused drawings the green stained fishnet studded with bits 
of looking glass in imitation of scales a square goldframed mirror over the mantel and 
one of eugene's drawingsthe three engines in the gray lowering weather standing large and impressive 
upon an easel it seemed to angela the perfection of beauty she saw the difference 
now between the tawdry gorgeousness of a commonplace hotel and this selection and arrangement of 
individual taste the glowing candelabrum of seven candles on either side of the square mirror 
surprised her deeply the black walnut piano in the alcove behind the half draped net 
drew forth an exclamation of delight oh how lovely it all is she exclaimed and 
ran to eugene to be kissed he fondled her for a few minutes and then 
she left again to examine in detail pictures pieces of furniture ornaments of brass and 
copper when did you get all this she asked for eugene had not told her 
of his luck in finding the departing dexter and leasing it for the rent of 
the studio and its care he was lighting the fire in the grate which had 
been prepared by the house attendant oh it isn't mine he replied easily i leased 
this from russell dexter he's going to be in europe until next winter i thought 
that would be easier than waiting around to fix up a place after you came 
we can get our things together next fall he was thinking he would be able 
to have his exhibition in the spring and perhaps that would bring some notable sales 
anyhow it might bring a few increase his repute and give him a greater earning 
power angela's heart sank just a little but she recovered in a moment for after 
all it was very exceptional even to be able to lease a place of this 
character she went to the window and looked out there was the great square with 
its four walls of houses the spread of trees still decorated with a few dusty 
leaves and the dozens of arc lights sputtering their white radiance in between the graceful 
arch cream white over at the entrance of fifth avenue it's so beautiful she exclaimed 
again coming back to eugene and putting her arms about him i didn't think it 
would be anything as fine as this you're so good to me she put up 
her lips and he kissed her pinching her cheeks together they walked to the kitchen 
the bedroom the bathroom then after a time they blew out the candles and retired 
for the night chapter ii after the quiet of a small town the monotony and 
simplicity of country life the dreary reiterated weariness of teaching a country school this new 
world into which angela was plunged seemed to her astonished eyes to be compounded of 
little save beauties curiosities and delights the human senses which weary so quickly of reiterated 
sensory impressions exaggerate with equal readiness the beauty and charm of the unaccustomed if it 
is new therefore it must be better than that which we have had of old 
the material details with which we are able to surround ourselves seem at times to 
remake our point of view if we have been poor wealth will seem temporarily to 
make us happy when we have been amid elements and personages discordant to our thoughts 
to be put among harmonious conditions seems for the time being to solve all our 
woes so little do we have that interior peace which no material conditions can truly 
affect or disturb when angela awoke the next morning this studio in which she was 
now to live seemed the most perfect habitation which could be devised by man the 
artistry of the arrangement of the rooms the charm of the conveniencesa bathroom with hot 
and cold water next to the bedroom a kitchen with an array of necessary utensils 
in the rear portion of the studio used as a diningroom a glimpse of the 
main studio gave her the sense of art which dealt with nature the beauty of 
the human form colors toneshow different from teaching school to her the difference between the 
long low rambling house at blackwood with its vine ornamented windows its somewhat haphazard arrangement 
of flowers and its great lawn and this peculiarly compact and ornate studio apartment looking 
out upon washington square was all in favor of the latter in angela's judgment there 
was no comparison she could not have understood if she could have seen into eugene's 
mind at this time how her home town her father's single farm the blue waters 
of the little lake near her door the shadows of the tall trees on her 
lawn were somehow compounded for him not only with classic beauty itself but with her 
own charm when she was among these things she partook of their beauty and was 
made more beautiful thereby she did not know how much she had lost in leaving 
them behind to her all these older elements of her life were shabby and unimportant 
pointless and to be neglected this new world was in its way for her an 
aladdin's cave of delight when she looked out on the great square for the first 
time the next morning seeing it bathed in sunlight a dignified line of red brick 
dwellings to the north a towering office building to the east trucks carts cars and 
vehicles clattering over the pavement below it all seemed gay with youth and energy we'll 
have to dress and go out to breakfast said eugene i didn't think to lay 
anything in as a matter of fact i wouldn't have known what to buy if 
i had wanted to i never tried housekeeping for myself oh that's all right said 
angela fondling his hands only let's not go out to breakfast unless we have to 
let's see what's here and she went back to the very small room devoted to 
cooking purposes to see what cooking utensils had been provided she had been dreaming of 
housekeeping and cooking for eugene of petting and spoiling him and now the opportunity had 
arrived she found that mr dexter their generous lessor had provided himself with many conveniencesbreakfast 
and dinner sets of brown and blue porcelain a coffee percolator a charming dull blue 
teapot with cups to match a chafing dish a set of waffle irons griddles spiders 
skillets stew and roasting pans and knives and forks of steel and silver in abundance 
obviously he had entertained from time to time for there were bread cake sugar flour 
and salt boxes and a little chest containing in small drawers various spices oh it 
will be easy to get something here said angela lighting the burners of the gas 
stove to see whether it was in good working order we can just go out 
to market if you'll come and show me once and get what we want it 
won't take a minute i'll know after that eugene consented gladly she had always fancied 
she would be an ideal housekeeper and now that she had her eugene she was 
anxious to begin it would be such a pleasure to show him what a manager 
she was how everything would go smoothly in her hands how careful she would be 
of his earningstheir joint possessions she was sorry now that she saw that art was 
no great producer of wealth that she had no money to bring him but she 
knew that eugene in the depth of his heart thought nothing of that he was 
too impractical he was a great artist but when it came to practical affairs she 
felt instinctively that she was much the wiser she had bought so long calculated so 
well for her sisters and brothers out of her bag for her trunks had not 
yet arrived she extracted a neat house dress of pale green linen which she put 
on after she had done up her hair in a cosy coil and together with 
eugene for a temporary guide they set forth to find the stores he had told 
her looking out the windows that there were lines of italian grocers butchers and vegetable 
men in the side streets leading south from the square and into one of these 
they now ventured the swarming impressive life of the street almost took her breath away 
it was so crowded potatoes tomatoes eggs flour butter lamb chops salta dozen little accessories 
were all purchased in small quantities and then they eagerly returned to the studio angela 
was a little disgusted with the appearance of some of the stores but some of 
them were clean enough it seemed so strange to her to be buying in an 
italian street with italian women and children about their swarthy leathern faces set with bright 
almost feverish eyes eugene in his brown corduroy suit and soft green hat watching and 
commenting at her side presented such a contrast he was so tall so exceptional so 
laconic i like them when they wear rings in their ears he said at one 
time get the coal man who looks like a bandit he observed at another this 
old woman here might do for the witch of endor angela attended strictly to her 
marketing she was gay and smiling but practical she was busy wondering in what quantities 
she should buy things how she would keep fresh vegetables whether the ice box was 
really clean how much delicate dusting the various objects in the studio would require the 
raw brick walls of the street the dirt and slops in the gutter the stray 
cats and dogs hungry and lean the swarming stream of people did not appeal to 
her as picturesque at all only when she heard eugene expatiating gravely did she begin 
to realize that all this must have artistic significance if eugene said so it did 
but it was a fascinating world whatever it was and it was obvious that she 
was going to be very very happy there was a breakfast in the studio then 
of hot biscuit with fresh butter an omelette with tomatoes potatoes stewed in cream and 
coffee after the long period of commonplace restaurant dining which eugene had endured this seemed 
ideal to sit in your own private apartment with a charming wife opposite you ready 
to render you any service and with an array of food before you which revived 
the finest memories in your gustatory experience seemed perfect nothing could be better he saw 
visions of a happy future if he could finance this sort of thing it would 
require a lot of money more than he had been making but he thought he 
could make out after breakfast angela played on the piano and then eugene wanting to 
work she started housekeeping in earnest the trunks arriving gave her the task of unpacking 
and with that and lunch and dinner to say nothing of love she had sufficient 
to do it was a charming existence for a little while eugene suggested that they 
should have smite and machugh to dinner first of all these being his closest friends 
angela agreed heartily for she was only too anxious to meet the people he knew 
she wanted to show him she knew how to receive and entertain as well as 
anyone she made great preparations for the wednesday evening followingthe night fixed for the dinnerand 
when it came was on the qui vive to see what his friends were like 
and what they would think of her the occasion passed off smoothly enough and was 
the occasion of considerable jollity these two cheerful worthies were greatly impressed with the studio 
they were quick to praise it before angela and to congratulate him on his good 
fortune in having married her angela in the same dress in which she had appeared 
at dinner in buffalo was impressive her mass of yellow hair fascinated the gaze of 
both smite and machugh gee what hair smite observed secretly to machugh when neither angela 
nor eugene were within hearing distance you're right returned machugh she's not at all bad 
looking is she i should say not returned smite who admired angela's simple goodnatured western 
manners a little later more subtly they expressed their admiration to her and she was 
greatly pleased marietta who had arrived late that afternoon had not made her appearance yet 
she was in the one available studio bedroom making her toilet angela in spite of 
her fine raiment was busy superintending the cooking for although through the janitor she had 
managed to negotiate the loan of a girl to serve she could not get anyone 
to cook a soup a fish a chicken and a salad were the order of 
procedure marietta finally appeared ravishing in pink silk both smite and machugh sat up and 
marietta proceeded to bewitch them marietta knew no order or distinctions in men they were 
all slaves to hervictims to be stuck on the spit of her beauty and broiled 
in their amorous uncertainties at her leisure in after years eugene learned to speak of 
marietta's smile as the dagger the moment she appeared smiling he would say ah we 
have it out again have we who gets the blade this evening poor victim being 
her brotherinlaw now he was free to slip his arm about her waist and she 
took this family connection as license to kiss him there was something about eugene which 
held her always during these very first days she gratified her desire to be in 
his arms but always with a sense of reserve which kept him in check she 
wondered secretly how much he liked her smite and machugh when she appeared both rose 
to do her service machugh offered her his chair by the fire smite bestirred himself 
in an aimless fashion i've just had such a dandy week up at west point 
began marietta cheerfully dancing seeing dress parades walking with the soldier boys i warn you 
two here and now began eugene who had already learned to tease marietta that you're 
not safe this woman here is dangerous as artists in good standing you had better 
look out for yourselves oh eugene how you talk laughed marietta her teeth showing effectively 
mr smite i leave it to you isn't that a mean way to introduce a 
sisterinlaw i'm here for just a few days too and have so little time i 
think it cruel it's a shame said smite who was plainly a willing victim you 
ought to have another kind of brotherinlaw if you had some people i know now 
it's an outrage commented machugh there's one thing though you may not require so very 
much time now i think that's ungallant marietta laughed i see i'm all alone here 
except for mr smite never mind you all will be sorry when i'm gone i 
believe that replied machugh feelingly smite simply stared he was lost in admiration of her 
cream and peach complexion her fluffy silky brown hair her bright blue eyes and plump 
rounded arms such radiant good nature would be heavenly to live with he wondered what 
sort of a family this was that eugene had become connected with angela marietta a 
brother at west point they must be nice conservative welltodo western people marietta went to 
help her sister and smite in the absence of eugene said: say he's in right 
isn't he she's a peach she's got it a little on her sister machugh merely 
stared at the room he was taken with the complexion and arrangement of things generally 
the old furniture the rugs the hangings the pictures eugene's borrowed maid servant in a 
white apron and cap angela marietta the bright table set with colored china and an 
arrangement of silver candlestickseugene had certainly changed the tenor of his life radically within the 
last ten days why he was marvellously fortunate this studio was a wonderful piece of 
luck some peopleand he shook his head meditatively well said eugene coming back after some 
final touches to his appearance what do you think of it peter you're certainly moving 
along eugene i never expected to see it you ought to praise god you're plain 
lucky eugene smiled enigmatically he was wondering whether he was neither smite nor machugh nor 
anyone could dream of the conditions under which this came about what a sham the 
world was anyhow it's surface appearances so ridiculously deceptive if anyone had known of the 
apparent necessity when he first started to look for an apartment of his own mood 
toward it marietta came back and angela the latter had taken kindly to both these 
men or boys as she already considered them eugene had a talent for reducing everybody 
to simply folks as he called them so these two capable and talented men were 
mere country boys like himselfand angela caught his attitude i'd like to have you let 
me make a sketch of you some day mrs witla machugh said to angela when 
she came back to the fire he was essaying portraiture as a side line and 
he was anxious for good opportunities to practice angela thrilled at the invitation and the 
use of her new name mrs witla by eugene's old friends i'd be delighted she 
replied flushing my word you look nice angelface exclaimed marietta catching her about the waist 
you paint her with her hair down in braids mr machugh she makes a stunning 
gretchen angela flushed anew i've been reserving that for myself peter said eugene but you 
try your hand at it i'm not much in portraiture anyhow smite smiled at marietta 
he wished he could paint her but he was poor at figure work except as 
incidental characters in sea scenes he could do men better than he could women if 
you were an old sea captain now miss blue he said to marietta gallantly i 
could make a striking thing out of you i'll try to be if you want 
to paint me she replied gaily i'd look fine in a big pair of boots 
and a raincoat wouldn't i eugene you certainly would if i'm any judge replied smite 
come over to the studio and i'll rig you out i have all those things 
on hand i will she replied laughing you just say the word machugh felt as 
if smite were stealing a march on him he wanted to be nice to marietta 
to have her take an interest in him now looky joseph he protested i was 
going to suggest making a study of miss blue myself well you're too late replied 
smite you didn't speak quick enough marietta was greatly impressed with this atmosphere in which 
angela and eugene were living she expected to see something artistic but nothing so nice 
as this particular studio angela explained to her that eugene did not own it but 
that made small difference in marietta's estimate of its significance eugene had it his art 
and social connections brought it about they were beginning excellently well if she could have 
as nice a home when she started on her married career she would be satisfied 
they sat down about the round teak table which was one of dexter's prized possessions 
and were served by angela's borrowed maid the conversation was light and for the most 
part pointless serving only to familiarize these people with each other both angela and marietta 
were taken with the two artists because they felt in them a note of homely 
conservatism these men spoke easily and naturally of the trials and triumphs of art life 
and the difficulty of making a good living and seemed to be at home with 
personages of repute in one world and another its greatest reward during the dinner smite 
narrated experiences in his seafaring life and machugh of his mountain camping experiences in the 
west marietta described experiences with her beaux in wisconsin and characteristics of her yokel neighbors 
at blackwood angela joining in finally machugh drew a pencil sketch of marietta followed by 
a long train of admiring yokels her eyes turned up in a very shy deceptive 
manner now i think that's cruel she declared when eugene laughed heartily i never look 
like that that's just the way you look and do he declared you're the broad 
and flowery path that leadeth to destruction never mind babyette put in angela i'll take 
your part if no one else will you're a nice demure shrinking girl and you 
wouldn't look at anyone would you angela got up and was holding marietta's head mock 
sympathetically in her arms say that's a dandy pet name called smite moved by marietta's 
beauty poor marietta observed eugene come over here to me and i'll sympathize with you 
you don't take my drawing in the right spirit miss blue put in machugh cheerfully 
it's simply to show how popular you are angela stood beside eugene as her guests 
departed her slender arm about his waist marietta was coquetting finally with machugh these two 
friends of his thought eugene had the privilege of singleness to be gay and alluring 
to her with him that was over now he could not be that way to 
any girl any more he had to behavebe calm and circumspect it cut him this 
thought he saw at once it was not in accord with his nature he wanted 
to do just as he had always donemake love to marietta if she would let 
him but he could not he walked to the fire when the studio door was 
closed they're such nice boys exclaimed marietta i think mr machugh is as funny as 
he can be he has such droll wit smite is nice too replied eugene defensively 
they're both lovelyjust lovely returned marietta i like mr machugh a little the besthe's quainter 
said angela but i think mr smite is just as nice as he can be 
he's so old fashioned there's not anyone as nice as my eugene though she said 
affectionately putting her arm about him oh dear you two exclaimed marietta well i'm going 
to bed eugene sighed they had arranged a couch for her which could be put 
behind the silverspangled fish net in the alcove when company was gone eugene thought what 
a pity that already this affection of angela's was old to him it was not 
as it would be if he had taken marietta or christina they went to their 
bed room to retire and then he saw that all he had was passion must 
he be satisfied with that could he be it started a chain of thought which 
while persistently interrupted or befogged was really never broken momentary sympathy desire admiration might obscure 
it but always fundamentally it was there he had made a mistake he had put 
his head in a noose he had subjected himself to conditions which he did not 
sincerely approve of how was he going to remedy thisor could it ever be remedied 
chapter iii whatever were eugene's secret thoughts he began his married life with the outward 
air of one who takes it seriously enough now that he was married was actually 
bound by legal ties he felt that he might as well make the best of 
it he had once had the notion that it might be possible to say nothing 
of his marriage and keep angela in the background but this notion had been dispelled 
by the attitude of machugh and smite to say nothing of angela so he began 
to consider the necessity of notifying his friendsmiriam finch and norma whitmore and possibly christina 
channing when she should return these three women offered the largest difficulty to his mind 
he felt the commentary which their personalities represented what would they think of him what 
of angela now that she was right here in the city he could see that 
she represented a different order of thought he had opened the campaign by suggesting that 
they invite smite and machugh the thing to do now was to go further in 
this matter the one thing that troubled him was the thought of breaking the news 
to miriam finch for christina channing was away and norma whitmore was not of sufficient 
importance he argued now that he should have done this beforehand but having neglected that 
it behoved him to act at once he did so finally writing to norma whitmore 
and saying for he had no long explanation to makeyours truly is married may i 
bring my wife up to see you miss whitmore was truly taken by surprise she 
was sorry at firstverybecause eugene interested her greatly and she was afraid he would make 
a mistake in his marriage but she hastened to make the best of a bad 
turn on the part of fate and wrote a note which ran as follows: dear 
eugene and eugene's wife: this is news as is news congratulations and i am coming 
right down as soon as i get my breath and then you two must come 
to see me norma whitmore eugene was pleased and grateful that she took it so 
nicely but angela was the least big chagrined secretly that he had not told her 
before why hadn't he was this someone that he was interested in those three years 
in which she had doubtingly waited for eugene had whetted her suspicions and nurtured her 
fears still she tried to make little of it and to put on an air 
of joyousness she would be so glad to meet miss whitmore eugene told her how 
kind she had been to him how much she admired his art how helpful she 
was in bringing together young literary and artistic people and how influential with those who 
counted she could do him many a good turn angela listened patiently but she was 
just the least bit resentful that he should think so much of any one woman 
outside of herself why should he eugene witla be dependent on the favor of any 
woman of course she must be very nice and they would be good friends but 
norma came one afternoon two days later with the atmosphere of enthusiasm trailing as it 
seemed to eugene like a cloud of glory about her she was both fire and 
strength to him in her regard and sympathy even though she resented ever so slightly 
his affectional desertion you piggywiggy eugene witla she exclaimed what do you mean by running 
off and getting married and never saying a word i never even had a chance 
to get you a present and now i have to bring it isn't this a 
charming placewhy it's perfectly delightful and as she laid her present down unopened she looked 
about to see where mrs eugene witla might be angela was in the bedroom finishing 
her toilet she was expecting this descent and so was prepared being suitably dressed in 
the light green house gown when she heard miss whitmore's familiar mode of address she 
winced for this spoke volumes for a boon companionship of long endurance eugene hadn't said 
so much of miss whitmore in the past as he had recently but she could 
see that they were very intimate she looked out and saw herthis tall not very 
shapely but graceful woman whose whole being represented dynamic energy awareness subtlety of perception eugene 
was shaking her hand and looking genially into her face why should eugene like her 
so much she asked herself instantly why did his face shine with that light of 
intense enthusiasm the piggywiggy eugene witla expression irritated her it sounded as though she might 
be in love with him she came out after a moment with a glad smile 
on her face and approached with every show of good feeling but miss whitmore could 
sense opposition so this is mrs witla she exclaimed kissing her i'm delighted to know 
you i have always wondered what sort of a girl mr witla would marry you'll 
just have to pardon my calling him eugene i'll get over it after a bit 
i suppose now that he's married but we've been such good friends and i admire 
his work so much how do you like studio lifeor are you used to it 
angela who was taking in every detail of eugene's old friend replied in what seemed 
an affected tone that no she wasn't used to studio life: she was just from 
the country you knowa regular farmer girlblackwood wisconsin no less she stopped to let norma 
express friendly surprise and then went on to say that she supposed eugene had not 
said very much about her but he wrote her often enough she was rejoicing in 
the fact that whatever slight eugene's previous silence seemed to put upon her she had 
the satisfaction that she had won him after all and miss whitmore had not she 
fancied from miss whitmore's enthusiastic attitude that she must like eugene very much and she 
could see now what sort of women might have made him wish to delay who 
were the others she wondered they talked of metropolitan experiences generally marietta came in from 
a shopping expedition with a mrs link wife of an army captain acting as an 
instructor at west point and tea was served immediately afterward miss whitmore was insistent that 
they should come and take dinner with her some evening eugene confided that he was 
sending a painting to the academy they'll hang it of course assured norma but you 
ought to have an exhibition of your own marietta gushed about the wonder of the 
big stores and so it finally came time for miss whitmore to go now you 
will come up won't you she said to angela for in spite of a certain 
feeling of incompatibility and difference she was determined to like her she thought angela a 
little inexperienced and presumptuous in marrying eugene she was afraid she was not up to 
his standard still she was quaint piquant perhaps she would do very well angela was 
thinking all the while that miss whitmore was presuming on her old acquaintance with eugenethat 
she was too affected and enthusiastic there was another day on which miriam finch called 
richard wheeler having learned at smite's and machugh's studio of eugene's marriage and present whereabouts 
had hurried over and then immediately afterwards off to miriam finch's studio surprised himself he 
knew that she would be more so witla's married he exclaimed bursting into her room 
and for the moment miriam lost her selfpossession sufficiently to reply almost dramatically: richard wheeler 
what are you talking about you don't mean that do you he's married insisted wheeler 
and he's living down in washington square is the number he has the cutest yellowhaired 
wife you ever saw angela had been nice to wheeler and he liked her he 
liked the air of this domicile and thought it was going to be a good 
thing for eugene he needed to settle down and work hard miriam winced mentally at 
the picture she was hurt by this deception of eugene's chagrined because he had not 
thought enough of her even to indicate that he was going to get married he's 
been married ten days communicated wheeler and this added force to her temporary chagrin the 
fact that angela was yellowhaired and cute was also disturbing well she finally exclaimed cheerfully 
he might have said something to us mightn't he and she covered her own original 
confusion by a gay nonchalance which showed nothing of what she was really thinking this 
was certainly indifference on eugene's part and yet why shouldn't he he had never proposed 
to her still they had been so intimate mentally she was interested to see angela 
she wondered what sort of a woman she really was yellowhaired cute of course like 
all men eugene had sacrificed intellect and mental charm for a dainty form and a 
pretty face it seemed queer but she had fancied that he would not do thatthat 
his wife if he ever took one would be tall perhaps and gracious and of 
a beautiful mindsomeone distinguished why would men intellectual men artistic men any kind of men 
invariably make fools of themselves well she would go and see her because wheeler informed 
him that he had told miriam eugene wrote saying as briefly as possible that he 
was married and that he wanted to bring angela to her studio for reply she 
came herself gay smiling immaculately dressed anxious to hurt angela because she had proved the 
victor she also wanted to show eugene how little difference it all made to her 
you certainly are a secretive young man mr eugene witla she exclaimed when she saw 
him why didn't you make him tell us mrs witla she demanded archly of angela 
but with a secret dagger thrust in her eyes you'd think he didn't want us 
to know angela cowered beneath the sting of this whip cord miriam made her feel 
as though eugene had attempted to conceal his relationship to heras though he was ashamed 
of her how many more women were there like miriam and norma whitmore eugene was 
gaily unconscious of the real animus in miriam's conversation and now that the first cruel 
moment was over was talking glibly of things in general anxious to make everything seem 
as simple and natural as possible he was working at one of his pictures when 
miriam came in and was eager to obtain her critical opinion since it was nearly 
done she squinted at it narrowly but said nothing when he asked ordinarily she would 
have applauded it vigorously she did think it exceptional but was determined to say nothing 
she walked indifferently about examining this and that object in a superior way asking how 
he came to obtain the studio congratulating him upon his good luck angela she decided 
was interesting but not in eugene's class mentally and should be ignored he had made 
a mistake that was plain now you must bring mrs witla up to see me 
she said on leaving i'll play and sing all my latest songs for you i 
have made some of the daintest discoveries in old italian and spanish pieces angela who 
had posed to eugene as knowing something about music resented this superior invitation without inquiry 
as to her own possible ability or taste as she did miriam's entire attitude why 
was she so haughtyso superior what was it to her whether eugene had said anything 
about her or not she said nothing to show that she herself played but she 
wondered that eugene said nothing it seemed neglectful and inconsiderate of him he was busy 
wondering what miriam thought of his picture miriam took his hand warmly at parting looked 
cheerfully into his eyes and said i know you two are going to be irrationally 
happy and went out eugene felt the irritation at last he knew angela felt something 
miriam was resentful that was it she was angry at him for his seeming indifference 
she had commented to herself on angela's appearance and to her disadvantage in her manner 
had been the statement that his wife was not very important after all not of 
the artistic and superior world to which she and he belonged how do you like 
her he asked tentatively after she had gone feeling a strong current of opposition but 
not knowing on what it might be based exactly i don't like her returned angela 
petulantly she thinks she's sweet she treats you as though she thought you were her 
personal property she openly insulted me about your not telling her miss whitmore did the 
same thingthey all do they all will oh she suddenly burst into tears and ran 
crying toward their bedroom eugene followed astonished ashamed rebuked guilty minded almost terrorstrickenhe hardly knew 
what why angela he urged pleadingly leaning over her and attempting to raise her you 
know that isn't true it is it is she insisted don't touch me don't come 
near me you know it is true you don't love me you haven't treated me 
right at all since i've been here you haven't done anything that you should have 
done she insulted me openly to my face she was speaking with sobs and eugene 
was at once pained and terrorized by the persistent and unexpected display of emotion he 
had never seen angela like this before he had never seen any woman so why 
angelface he urged how can you go on like this you know what you say 
isn't true what have i done you haven't told your friendsthat's what you haven't done 
she exclaimed between gasps they still think you're single you keep me here hidden in 
the background as though i were awere ai don't know what your friends come and 
insult me openly to my face they do they do oh and she sobbed anew 
she knew very well what she was doing in her anger and rage she felt 
that she was acting in the right way eugene needed a severe reproof he had 
acted very badly and this was the way to administer it to him now in 
the beginning his conduct was indefensible and only the fact that he was an artist 
immersed in cloudy artistic thoughts and not really subject to the ordinary conventions of life 
saved him in her estimation it didn't matter that she had urged him to marry 
her it didn't absolve him that he had done so she thought he owed her 
that anyhow they were married now and he should do the proper thing eugene stood 
there cut as with a knife by this terrific charge he had not meant anything 
by concealing her presence he thought he had only endeavored to protect himself very slightly 
temporarily you oughtn't to say that angela he pleaded there aren't any more that don't 
knowat least any more that i care anything about i didn't think i didn't mean 
to conceal anything i'll write to everybody that might be interested he still felt hurt 
that she should brutally attack him this way even in her sorrow he was wrong 
no doubt but she was this a way to act this the nature of true 
love he mentally writhed and twisted taking her up in his arms smoothing her hair 
he asked her to forgive him finally when she thought she had punished him enough 
and that he was truly sorry and would make amends in the future she pretended 
to listen and then of a sudden threw her arms about his neck and began 
to hug and kiss him passion of course was the end of this but the 
whole thing left a disagreeable taste in eugene's mouth he did not like scenes he 
preferred the lofty indifference of miriam the gay subterfuge of norma the supreme stoicism of 
christina channing this noisy tempestuous angry emotion was not quite the thing to have introduced 
into his life he did not see how that would make for love between them 
still angela was sweet he thought she was a little girlnot as wise as norma 
whitmore not as selfprotective as miriam finch or christina channing perhaps after all she needed 
his care and affection maybe it was best for her and for him that he 
had married her so thinking he rocked her in his arms and angela lying there 
was satisfied she had won a most important victory she was starting right she was 
starting eugene right she would get the moral mental and emotional upper hand of him 
and keep it then these women who thought themselves so superior could go their way 
she would have eugene and he would be a great man and she would be 
his wife that was all she wanted chapter iv the result of angela's outburst was 
that eugene hastened to notify those whom he had not already informedshotmeyer his father and 
mother sylvia myrtle hudson dulaand received in return cards and letters of congratulation expressing surprise 
and interest which he presented to angela in a conciliatory spirit she realized after it 
was all over that she had given him an unpleasant shock and was anxious to 
make up to him in personal affection what she had apparently compelled him to suffer 
for policy's sake eugene did not know that in angela despite her smallness of body 
and what seemed to him her babyishness of spirit he had to deal with a 
thinking woman who was quite wise as to ways and means of handling her personal 
affairs she was of course whirled in the maelstrom of her affection for eugene and 
this was confusing and she did not understand the emotional and philosophic reaches of his 
mind but she did understand instinctively what made for a stable relationship between husband and 
wife and between any married couple and the world to her the utterance of the 
marriage vow meant just what it said that they would cleave each to the other 
there should be henceforth no thoughts feelings or emotions and decidedly no actions which would 
not conform with the letter and the spirit of the marriage vow eugene had sensed 
something of this but not accurately or completely he did not correctly estimate either the 
courage or the rigidity of her beliefs and convictions he thought that her character might 
possibly partake of some of his own easy tolerance and good nature she must know 
that peoplemen particularlywere more or less unstable in their makeup life could not be governed 
by hard and fast rules why everybody knew that you might try and should hold 
yourself in check as much as possible for the sake of selfpreservation and social appearances 
but if you erredand you might easilyit was no crime certainly it was no crime 
to look at another woman longingly if you went astray overbalanced by your desires wasn't 
it after all in the scheme of things did we make our desires certainly we 
did not and if we did not succeed completely in controlling themwell the drift of 
life into which they now settled was interesting enough though for eugene it was complicated 
with the thought of possible failure for he was as might well be expected of 
such a temperament of a worrying nature and inclined in his hours of ordinary effort 
to look on the dark side of things the fact that he had married angela 
against his will the fact that he had no definite art connections which produced him 
as yet anything more than two thousand dollars a year the fact that he had 
assumed financial obligations which doubled the cost of food clothing entertainment and rentfor their studio 
was costing him thirty dollars more than had his share of the smitemachugh chambersweighed on 
him the dinner which he had given to smite and machugh had cost about eight 
dollars over and above the ordinary expenses of the week others of a similar character 
would cost as much and more he would have to take angela to the theatre 
occasionally there would be the need of furnishing a new studio the following fall unless 
another such windfall as this manifested itself although angela had equipped herself with a varied 
and serviceable trousseau her clothes would not last forever odd necessities began to crop up 
not long after they were married and he began to see that if they lived 
with anything like the freedom and care with which he had before he was married 
his income would have to be larger and surer the energy which these thoughts provoked 
was not without result for one thing he sent the original of the east side 
picture six o'clock to the american academy of design exhibitiona thing which he might have 
done long before but failed to do angela had heard from eugene that the national 
academy of design was a forum for the display of art to which the public 
was invited or admitted for a charge to have a picture accepted by this society 
and hung on the line was in its way a mark of merit and approval 
though eugene did not think very highly of it all the pictures were judged by 
a jury of artists which decided whether they should be admitted or rejected and if 
admitted whether they should be given a place of honor or hung in some inconspicuous 
position to be hung on the line was to have your picture placed in the 
lower tier where the light was excellent and the public could get a good view 
of it eugene had thought the first two years he was in new york that 
he was really not sufficiently experienced or meritorious and the previous year he had thought 
that he would hoard all that he was doing for his first appearance in some 
exhibition of his own thinking the national academy commonplace and retrogressive the exhibitions he had 
seen thus far had been full of commonplace deadandalive stuff he thought it was no 
great honor to be admitted to such a collection now because machugh was trying and 
because he had accumulated nearly enough pictures for exhibition at a private gallery which he 
hoped to interest he was anxious to see what the standard body of american artists 
thought of his work they might reject him if so that would merely prove that 
they did not recognize a radical departure from accepted methods and subject matter as art 
the impressionists he understood were being so ignored later they would accept him if he 
were admitted it would simply mean that they knew better than he believed they did 
i believe i will do it he said i'd like to know what they think 
of my stuff anyhow the picture was sent as he had planned and to his 
immense satisfaction it was accepted and hung it did not for some reason attract as 
much attention as it might but it was not without its modicum of praise owen 
overman the poet met him in the general reception entrance of the academy on the 
opening night and congratulated him sincerely i remember seeing that in truth he said but 
it's much better in the original it's fine you ought to do a lot of 
those things i am replied eugene i expect to have a show of my own 
one of these days he called angela who had wandered away to look at a 
piece of statuary and introduced her i was just telling your husband how much i 
like his picture overman informed her angela was flattered that her husband was so much 
of a personage that he could have his picture hung in a great exhibition such 
as this with its walls crowded with what seemed to her magnificent canvases and its 
rooms filled with important and distinguished people as they strolled about eugene pointed out to 
her this well known artist and that writer saying almost always that they were very 
able he knew three or four of the celebrated collectors prize givers and art patrons 
by sight and told angela who they were there were a number of striking looking 
models present whom eugene knew either by reputation whispered comment of friends or personallyzelma desmond 
who had posed for eugene hedda anderson anna magruder and laura matthewson among others angela 
was struck and in a way taken by the dash and beauty of these girls 
they carried themselves with an air of personal freedom and courage which surprised her hedda 
anderson was bold in her appearance but immensely smart her manner seemed to comment on 
the ordinary woman as being indifferent and not worth while she looked at angela walking 
with eugene and wondered who she was isn't she striking observed angela not knowing she 
was anyone whom eugene knew i know her well he replied she's a model just 
then miss anderson in return for his nod gave him a fetching smile angela chilled 
elizabeth stein passed by and he nodded to her who is she asked angela she's 
a socialist agitator and radical she sometimes speaks from a soapbox on the east side 
angela studied her carefully her waxen complexion smooth black hair laid in even plaits over 
her forehead her straight thin chiseled nose even red lips and low forehead indicated a 
daring and subtle soul angela did not understand her she could not understand a girl 
as good looking as that doing any such thing as eugene said and yet she 
had a bold rather free and easy air she thought eugene certainly knew strange people 
he introduced to her william mcconnell hudson dula who had not yet been to see 
them jan jansen louis deesa leonard baker and paynter stone in regard to eugene's picture 
the papers with one exception had nothing to say but this one in both eugene's 
and angela's minds made up for all the others it was the evening sun a 
most excellent medium for art opinion and it was very definite in its conclusions in 
regard to this particular work the statement was: a new painter eugene witla has an 
oil entitled 'six o'clock' which for directness virility sympathy faithfulness to detail and what for 
want of a better term we may call totality of spirit is quite the best 
thing in the exhibition it looks rather out of place surrounded by the weak and 
spindling interpretations of scenery and water which so readily find a place in the exhibition 
of the academy but it is none the weaker for that the artist has a 
new crude raw and almost rough method but his picture seems to say quite clearly 
what he sees and feels he may have to waitif this is not a single 
burst of abilitybut he will have a hearing there is no question of that eugene 
witla is an artist eugene thrilled when he read this commentary it was quite what 
he would have said himself if he had dared angela was beside herself with joy 
who was the critic who had said this they wondered what was he like he 
must be truly an intellectual personage eugene wanted to go and look him up if 
one saw his talent now others would see it later it was for this reasonthough 
the picture subsequently came back to him unsold and unmentioned so far as merit or 
prizes were concernedthat he decided to try for an exhibition of his own chapter v 
the hope of famewhat hours of speculation what pulses of enthusiasm what fevers of effort 
are based on that peculiarly subtle illusion it is yet the lure the ignis fatuus 
of almost every breathing heart in the young particularly it burns with the sweetness and 
perfume of spring fires then most of all does there seem substantial reality in the 
shadow of famethose deep beautiful illusions which tremendous figures throw over the world attainable it 
seems must be the peace and plenty and sweet content of famethat glamour of achievement 
that never was on sea or land fame partakes of the beauty and freshness of 
the morning it has in it the odour of the rose the feel of rich 
satin the color of the cheeks of youth if we could but be famous when 
we dream of fame and not when locks are tinged with grey faces seamed with 
the lines that speak of past struggles and eyes wearied with the tensity the longings 
and the despairs of years to bestride the world in the morning of life to 
walk amid the plaudits and the huzzahs when love and faith are young to feel 
youth and the world's affection when youth and health are sweetwhat dream is that of 
pure sunlight and moonlight compounded a sunkissed breath of mist in the sky the reflection 
of moonlight upon water the remembrance of dreams to the waking mindof such is fame 
in our youth and never afterward by such an illusion was eugene's mind possessed he 
had no conception of what life would bring him for his efforts he thought if 
he could have his pictures hung in a fifth avenue gallery much as he had 
seen bouguereau's venus in chicago with people coming as he had come on that occasionit 
would be of great comfort and satisfaction to him if he could paint something which 
would be purchased by the metropolitan museum in new york he would then be somewhat 
of a classic figure ranking with corot and daubigny and rousseau of the french or 
with turner and watts and millais of the english the leading artistic figures of his 
pantheon these men seemed to have something which he did not have he thought a 
greater breadth of technique a finer comprehension of color and character a feeling for the 
subtleties at the back of life which somehow showed through what they did larger experience 
larger vision larger feelingthese things seemed to be imminent in the great pictures exhibited here 
and it made him a little uncertain of himself only the criticism in the evening 
sun fortified him against all thought of failure he was an artist he gathered up 
the various oils he had donethere were some twentysix all told now scenes of the 
rivers the streets the night life and so forthand went over them carefully touching up 
details which in the beginning he had merely sketched or indicated adding to the force 
of a spot of color here modifying a tone or shade there and finally after 
much brooding over the possible result set forth to find a gallery which would give 
them place and commercial approval eugene's feeling was that they were a little raw and 
sketchythat they might not have sufficient human appeal seeing that they dealt with factory architecture 
at times scows tugs engines the elevated roads in raw reds yellows and blacks but 
machugh dula smite miss finch christina the evening sun norma whitmore all had praised them 
or some of them was not the world much more interested in the form and 
spirit of classic beauty such as that represented by sir john millais would it not 
prefer rossetti's blessed damozel to any street scene ever painted he could never be sure 
in the very hour of his triumph when the sun had just praised his picture 
there lurked the spectre of possible intrinsic weakness did the world wish this sort of 
thing would it ever buy of him was he of any real value no artist 
heart one might have answered of no more value than any other worker of existence 
and no less the sunlight on the corn the color of dawn in the maid's 
cheek the moonlight on the waterthese are of value and of no value according to 
the soul to whom is the appeal fear not of dreams and the beauty of 
dreams is the world compounded kellner and son purveyors of artistic treasures by both past 
and present masters with offices in fifth avenue near twentyeighth street was the one truly 
significant firm of artdealers in the city the pictures in the windows of kellner and 
son the exhibitions in their very exclusive show rooms the general approval which their discriminating 
taste evoked had attracted the attention of artists and the lay public for fully thirty 
years eugene had followed their shows with interest ever since he had been in new 
york he had seen every now and then a most astonishing picture of one school 
or another displayed in their imposing shop window and had heard artists comment from time 
to time on other things there with considerable enthusiasm the first important picture of the 
impressionistic schoola heavy spring rain in a grove of silver poplars by winthrophad been shown 
in the window of this firm fascinating eugene with its technique he had encountered here 
collections of aubrey beardsley's decadent drawings of helleu's silverpoints of rodin's astonishing sculptures and thaulow's 
solid scandinavian eclecticism this house appeared to have capable artistic connections all over the world 
for the latest art force in italy spain switzerland or sweden was quite as likely 
to find its timely expression here as the more accredited work of england germany or 
france kellner and son were art connoisseurs in the best sense of the word and 
although the german founder of the house had died many years before its management and 
taste had never deteriorated eugene did not know at this time how very difficult it 
was to obtain an exhibition under kellner's auspices they being overcrowded with offers of art 
material and appeals for display from celebrated artists who were quite willing and able to 
pay for the space and time they occupied a fixed charge was made never deviated 
from except in rare instances where the talent of the artist his poverty and the 
advisability of the exhibition were extreme two hundred dollars was considered little enough for the 
use of one of their show rooms for ten days eugene had no such sum 
to spare but one day in january without any real knowledge as to what the 
conditions were he carried four of the reproductions which had been made from time to 
time in truth to the office of mr kellner certain that he had something to 
show miss whitmore had indicated to him that eberhard zang wanted him to come and 
see him but he thought if he was going anywhere he would prefer to go 
to kellner and son he wanted to explain to mr kellner if there were such 
a person that he had many more paintings which he considered even bettermore expressive of 
his growing understanding of american life and of himself and his technique he went in 
timidly albeit with quite an air for this adventure disturbed him much the american manager 
of kellner and son m anatole charles was a frenchman by birth and training familiar 
with the spirit and history of french art and with the drift and tendency of 
art in various other sections of the world he had been sent here by the 
home office in berlin not only because of his very thorough training in english art 
ways and because of his ability to select that type of picture which would attract 
attention and bring credit and prosperity to the house here and abroad but also because 
of his ability to make friends among the rich and powerful wherever he was and 
to sell one type of important picture after anotherhaving some knack or magnetic capacity for 
attracting to him those who cared for good art and were willing to pay for 
it his specialties of course were the canvases of the eminently successful artists in various 
parts of the worldthe living successful he knew by experience what soldhere in france in 
england in germany he was convinced that there was practically nothing of value in american 
art as yetcertainly not from the commercial point of view and very little from the 
artistic beyond a few canvases by inness homer sargent abbey whistler men who were more 
foreign or rather universal than american in their attitude he considered that the american art 
spirit was as yet young and raw and crude they do not seem to be 
grown up as yet over here he said to his intimate friends they paint little 
things in a forceful way but they do not seem as yet to see things 
as a whole i miss that sense of the universe in miniature which we find 
in the canvases of so many of the great europeans they are better illustrators than 
artists over herewhy i don't know m anatole charles spoke english almost more than perfectly 
he was an example of your true man of the worldpolished dignified immaculately dressed conservative 
in thought and of few words in expression critics and art enthusiasts were constantly running 
to him with this and that suggestion in regard to this and that artist but 
he only lifted his sophisticated eyebrows curled his superior mustachios pulled at his highly artistic 
goatee and exclaimed: ah or so he asserted always that he was most anxious to 
find talentprofitable talentthough on occasion and he would demonstrate that by an outward wave of 
his hands and a shrug of his shoulders the house of kellner and son was 
not averse to doing what it could for artand that for art's sake without any 
thought of profit whatsoever where are your artists he would ask i look and look 
whistler abbey inness sargentahthey are old where are the new ones well this onethe critic 
would probably persist well well i go i shall look but i have little hopevery 
very little hope he was constantly appearing under such pressure at this studio and thatexamining 
criticising alas he selected the work of but few artists for purposes of public exhibition 
and usually charged them well for it it was this man polished artistically superb in 
his way whom eugene was destined to meet this morning when he entered the sumptuously 
furnished office of m charles the latter arose he was seated at a little rosewood 
desk lighted by a lamp with green silk shade one glance told him that eugene 
was an artistvery likely of ability more than likely of a sensitive highstrung nature he 
had long since learned that politeness and savoir faire cost nothing it was the first 
essential so far as the good will of an artist was concerned eugene's card and 
message brought by a uniformed attendant had indicated the nature of his business as he 
approached m charles' raised eyebrows indicated that he would be very pleased to know what 
he could do for mr witla i should like to show you several reproductions of 
pictures of mine began eugene in his most courageous manner i have been working on 
a number with a view to making a show and i thought that possibly you 
might be interested in looking at them with a view to displaying them for me 
i have twentysix all told and ah that is a difficult thing to suggest replied 
m charles cautiously we have a great many exhibitions scheduled nowenough to carry us through 
two years if we considered nothing more obligations to artists with whom we have dealt 
in the past take up a great deal of our time contracts which our berlin 
and paris branches enter into sometimes crowd out our local shows entirely of course we 
are always anxious to make interesting exhibitions if opportunity should permit you know our charges 
no said eugene surprised that there should be any two hundred dollars for two weeks 
we do not take exhibitions for less than that time eugene's countenance fell he had 
expected quite a different reception nevertheless since he had brought them he untied the tape 
of the portfolio in which the prints were laid m charles looked at them curiously 
he was much impressed with the picture of the east side crowd at first but 
looking at one of fifth avenue in a snow storm the battered shabby bus pulled 
by a team of lean unkempt bony horses he paused struck by its force he 
liked the delineation of swirling winddriven snow the emptiness of this thoroughfare usually so crowded 
the buttoned huddled hunched withdrawn look of those who traveled it the exceptional details of 
piles of snow sifted on to window sills and ledges and into doorways and on 
to the windows of the bus itself attracted his attention an effective detail he said 
to eugene as one critic might say to another pointing to a line of white 
snow on the window of one side of the bus another dash of snow on 
a man's hat rim took his eye also i can feel the wind he added 
eugene smiled m charles passed on in silence to the steaming tug coming up the 
east river in the dark hauling two great freight barges he was saying to himself 
that after all eugene's art was that of merely seizing upon the obviously dramatic it 
wasn't so much the art of color composition and life analysis as it was stage 
craft the man before him had the ability to see the dramatic side of life 
still he turned to the last reproduction which was that of greeley square in a 
drizzling rain eugene by some mystery of his art had caught the exact texture of 
seeping water on gray stones in the glare of various electric lights he had caught 
the values of various kinds of lights those in cabs those in cable cars those 
in shop windows those in the street lamprelieving by them the black shadows of the 
crowds and of the sky the color work here was unmistakably good how large are 
the originals of these he asked thoughtfully nearly all of them thirty by forty eugene 
could not tell by his manner whether he were merely curious or interested all of 
them done in oil i fancy yes all they are not bad i must say 
he observed cautiously a little persistently dramatic but these reproductions began eugene hoping by criticising 
the press work to interest him in the superior quality of the originals yes i 
see m charles interrupted knowing full well what was coming they are very bad still 
they show well enough what the originals are like where is your studio washington square 
as i say went on m charles noting the address on eugene's card the opportunity 
for exhibition purposes is very limited and our charge is rather high we have so 
many things we would like to exhibitso many things we must exhibit it is hard 
to say when the situation would permitif you are interested i might come and see 
them sometime eugene looked perturbed two hundred dollars two hundred dollars could he afford it 
it would mean so much to him and yet the man was not at all 
anxious to rent him the show room even at this price i will come said 
m charles seeing his mood if you wish that is what you want me to 
do we have to be careful of what we exhibit here it isn't as if 
it were an ordinary show room i will drop you a card some day when 
occasion offers if you wish and you can let me know whether the time i 
suggest is all right i am rather anxious to see these scenes of yours they 
are very good of their kind it may beone never can tellan opportunity might offera 
week or ten days somewhere in between other things eugene sighed inwardly so this was 
how these things were done it wasn't very flattering still he must have an exhibition 
he could afford two hundred if he had to an exhibition elsewhere would not be 
so valuable he had expected to make a better impression than this i wish you 
would come he said at last meditatively i think i should like the space if 
i can get it i would like to know what you think m charles raised 
his eyebrows very well he said i will communicate with you eugene went out what 
a poor thing this exhibiting business was he thought here he had been dreaming of 
an exhibition at kellners which should be brought about without charge to him because they 
were tremendously impressed with his work now they did not even want his pictureswould charge 
him two hundred dollars to show them it was a great come downvery discouraging still 
he went home thinking it would do him some good the critics would discuss his 
work just as they did that of other artists they would have to see what 
he could do should it be that at last this thing which he had dreamed 
of and so deliberately planned had come true he had thought of an exhibition at 
kellner's as the last joyous thing to be attained in the world of rising art 
and now it looked as though he was near it it might actually be coming 
to pass this man wanted to see the rest of his work he was not 
opposed to looking at them what a triumph even that was chapter vi it was 
some little time before m charles condescended to write saying that if it was agreeable 
he would call wednesday morning january th at a m but the letter finally did 
come and this dispelled all his intermediary doubts and fears at last he was to 
have a hearing this man might see something in his work possibly take a fancy 
to it who could tell he showed the letter to angela with an easy air 
as though it were quite a matter of course but he felt intensely hopeful angela 
put the studio in perfect order for she knew what this visit meant to eugene 
and in her eager faithful way was anxious to help him as much as possible 
she bought flowers from the italian florist at the corner and put them in vases 
here and there she swept and dusted dressed herself immaculately in her most becoming house 
dress and waited with nerves at high tension for the fateful ring of the door 
bell eugene pretended to work at one of his pictures which he had done long 
beforethe raw jangling wall of an east side street with its swarms of children its 
shabby pushcarts its mass of eager shuffling pushing mortals the sense of rugged ground life 
running all through it but he had no heart for the work he was asking 
himself over and over what m charles would think thank heaven this studio looked so 
charming thank heaven angela was so dainty in her pale green gown with a single 
red coral pin at her throat he walked to the window and stared out at 
washington square with its bare windshaken branches of trees its snow its antlike pedestrians hurrying 
here and there if he were only richhow peacefully he would paint m charles could 
go to the devil the door bell rang angela clicked a button and up came 
m charles quietly they could hear his steps in the hall he knocked and eugene 
answered decidedly nervous in his mind but outwardly calm and dignified m charles entered clad 
in a furlined overcoat fur cap and yellow chamois gloves ah good morning said m 
charles in greeting a fine bracing day isn't it what a charming view you have 
here mrs witla i'm delighted to meet you i am a little late but i 
was unavoidably detained one of our german associates is in the city he divested himself 
of his great coat and rubbed his hands before the fire he tried now that 
he had unbent so far to be genial and considerate if he and eugene were 
to do any business in the future it must be so besides the picture on 
the easel before him near the window which for the time being he pretended not 
to see was an astonishingly virile thing of whose work did it remind himanybody's he 
confessed to himself as he stirred around among his numerous art memories that he recalled 
nothing exactly like it raw reds raw greens dirty grey paving stonessuch faces why this 
thing fairly shouted its facts it seemed to say: i'm dirty i am commonplace i 
am grim i am shabby but i am life and there was no apologizing for 
anything in it no glossing anything over bang smash crack came the facts one after 
another with a bitter brutal insistence on their soness why on moody days when he 
had felt sour and depressed he had seen somewhere a street that looked like this 
and there it wasdirty sad slovenly immoral drunkenanything everything but here it was thank god 
for a realist he said to himself as he looked for he knew life this 
cold connoisseur but he made no sign he looked at the tall slim frame of 
eugene his cheeks slightly sunken his eyes brightan artist every inch of him and then 
at angela small eager a sweet loving little woman and he was glad that he 
was going to be able to say that he would exhibit these things well he 
said pretending to look at the picture on the easel for the first time we 
might as well begin to look at these things i see you have one here 
very good i think quite forceful what others have you eugene was afraid this one 
hadn't appealed to him as much as he hoped it would and set it aside 
quickly picking up the second in the stock which stood against the wall covered by 
a green curtain it was the three engines entering the great freight yard abreast the 
smoke of the engines towering straight up like tall whitishgrey plumes in the damp cold 
air the sky lowering with blackishgrey clouds the red and yellow and blue cars standing 
out in the sodden darkness because of the water you could feel the cold wet 
drizzle the soppy tracks the weariness of throwing switches there was a lone brakeman in 
the foreground throwing a red brake signal he was quite black and evidently wet a 
symphony in grey said m charles succinctly they came swiftly after this without much comment 
from either eugene putting one canvas after another before him leaving it for a few 
moments and replacing it with another his estimate of his own work did not rise 
very rapidly for m charles was persistently distant but the latter could not help voicing 
approval of after the theatre a painting full of the wonder and bustle of a 
night crowd under sputtering electric lamps he saw that eugene had covered almost every phase 
of what might be called the dramatic spectacle in the public life of the city 
and much that did not appear dramatic until he touched itthe empty canyon of broadway 
at three o'clock in the morning a long line of giant milk wagons swinging curious 
lanterns coming up from the docks at four o'clock in the morning a plunging parade 
of fire vehicles the engines steaming smoke the people running or staring openmouthed a crowd 
of polite society figures emerging from the opera the bread line an italian boy throwing 
pigeons in the air from a basket on his arm in a crowded lower westside 
street everything he touched seemed to have romance and beauty and yet it was real 
and mostly grim and shabby i congratulate you mr witla finally exclaimed m charles moved 
by the ability of the man and feeling that caution was no longer necessary to 
me this is wonderful material much more effective than the reproductions show dramatic and true 
i question whether you will make any money out of it there is very little 
sale for american art in this country it might almost do better in europe it 
ought to sell but that is another matter the best things do not always sell 
readily it takes time still i will do what i can i will give these 
pictures a two weeks' display early in april without any charge to you whatever eugene 
started i will call them to the attention of those who know i will speak 
to those who buy it is an honor i assure you to do this i 
consider you an artist in every sense of the wordi might say a great artist 
you ought if you preserve yourself sanely and with caution to go far very far 
i shall be glad to send for these when the time comes eugene did not 
know how to reply to this he did not quite understand the european seriousness of 
method its appreciation of genius which was thus so easily and sincerely expressed in a 
formal way m charles meant every word he said this was one of those rare 
and gratifying moments of his life when he was permitted to extend to waiting and 
unrecognized genius the assurance of the consideration and approval of the world he stood there 
waiting to hear what eugene would say but the latter only flushed under his pale 
skin i'm very glad he said at last in his rather commonplace offhand american way 
i thought they were pretty good but i wasn't sure i'm very grateful to you 
you need not feel gratitude toward me returned m charles now modifying his formal manner 
you can congratulate yourselfyour art i am honored as i tell you we will make 
a fine display of them you have no frames for these well never mind i 
will lend you frames he smiled and shook eugene's hand and congratulated angela she had 
listened to this address with astonishment and swelling pride she had perceived despite eugene's manner 
the anxiety he was feeling the intense hopes he was building on the outcome of 
this meeting m charles' opening manner had deceived her she had felt that he did 
not care so much after all and that eugene was going to be disappointed now 
when this burst of approval came she hardly knew what to make of it she 
looked at eugene and saw that he was intensely moved by not only a sense 
of relief but pride and joy his pale dark face showed it to see this 
load of care taken off him whom she loved so deeply was enough to unsettle 
angela she found herself stirred in a pathetic way and now when m charles turned 
to her tears welled to her eyes don't cry mrs witla he said grandly on 
seeing this you have a right to be proud of your husband he is a 
great artist you should take care of him oh i'm so happy halflaughed and halfsobbed 
angela i can't help it she went over to where eugene was and put her 
face against his coat eugene slipped his arm about her and smiled sympathetically m charles 
smiled also proud of the effect of his words you both have a right to 
feel very happy he said little angela thought eugene this was your true wife for 
you your good woman her husband's success meant all to her she had no life 
of her ownnothing outside of him and his good fortune m charles smiled well i 
will be going now he said finally i will send for the pictures when the 
time comes and meanwhile you two must come with me to dinner i will let 
you know he bowed himself out with many assurances of good will and then angela 
and eugene looked at each other oh isn't it lovely honeybun she cried half giggling 
half crying she had begun to call him honeybun the first day they were married 
my eugene a great artist he said it was a great honor isn't that lovely 
and all the world is going to know it soon now isn't that fine oh 
dear i'm so proud and she threw her arms ecstatically about his neck eugene kissed 
her affectionately he was not thinking so much of her though as he was of 
kellner and sontheir great exhibit room the appearance of these twentyseven or thirty great pictures 
in gold frames the spectators who might come to see the newspaper criticisms the voices 
of approval now all his artist friends would know that he was considered a great 
artist he was to have a chance to associate on equal terms with men like 
sargent and whistler if he ever met them the world would hear of him widely 
his fame might go to the uttermost parts of the earth he went to the 
window after a time and looked out there came back to his mind alexandria the 
printing shop the peoples' furniture company in chicago the art students league the daily globe 
surely he had come by devious paths gee he exclaimed at last simply smite and 
machugh'll be glad to hear this i'll have to go over and tell them chapter 
vii the exhibition which followed in april was one of those things which happen to 
fortunate soulsa complete flowering out before the eyes of the world of its feelings emotions 
perceptions and understanding we all have our feelings and emotions but lack the power of 
selfexpression it is true the work and actions of any man are to some degree 
expressions of character but this is a different thing the details of most lives are 
not held up for public examination at any given time we do not see succinctly 
in any given place just what an individual thinks and feels even the artist is 
not always or often given the opportunity of collected public expression under conspicuous artistic auspices 
some are so fortunatemany are not eugene realized that fortune was showering its favors upon 
him when the time came m charles was so kind as to send for the 
pictures and to arrange all the details he had decided with eugene that because of 
the vigor of treatment and the prevailing color scheme black frames would be the best 
the principal exhibition room on the ground floor in which these paintings were to be 
hung was heavily draped in red velvet and against this background the different pictures stood 
out effectively eugene visited the show room at the time the pictures were being hung 
with angela with smite and machugh shotmeyer and others he had long since notified norma 
whitmore and miriam finch but not the latter until after wheeler had had time to 
tell her this also chagrined her for she felt in this as she had about 
his marriage that he was purposely neglecting her the dream finally materializeda room eighteen by 
forty hung with dark red velvet irradiated with a soft illuminating glow from hidden lamps 
in which eugene's pictures stood forth in all their rawness and realityalmost as vigorous as 
life itself to some people those who do not see life clearly and directly but 
only through other people's eyes they seemed more so for this reason eugene's exhibition of 
pictures was an astonishing thing to most of those who saw it it concerned phases 
of life which in the main they had but casually glanced at things which because 
they were commonplace and customary were supposedly beyond the pale of artistic significance one picture 
in particular a great hulking ungainly negro a positively animal man his ears thick and 
projecting his lips fat his nose flat his cheek bones prominent his whole body expressing 
brute strength and animal indifference to dirt and cold illustrated this point particularly he was 
standing in a cheap commonplace east side street the time evidently was a january or 
february morning his business was driving an ash cart and his occupation at the moment 
illustrated by the picture was that of lifting a great can of mixed ashes paper 
and garbage to the edge of the ungainly iron wagon his hands were immense and 
were covered with great red patched woolen and leather glovesdirty bulbous inconvenient one would have 
said his head and ears were swaddled about by a red flannel shawl or strip 
of cloth which was knotted under his pugnacious chin and his forehead shawl and all 
surmounted by a brown canvas cap with his badge and number as a garbage driver 
on it about his waist was tied a great piece of rough coffee sacking and 
his arms and legs looked as though he might have on two or three pairs 
of trousers and as many vests he was looking purblindly down the shabby street its 
hard crisp snow littered with tin cans paper bits of slop and offal dustgray ash 
dust was flying from his upturned can in the distance behind him was a milk 
wagon a few pedestrians a little thinly clad girl coming out of a delicatessen store 
over head were dull smallpaned windows some shutters with a few of their slats broken 
out a frowsy headed man looking out evidently to see whether the day was cold 
eugene was so cruel in his indictment of life he seemed to lay on his 
details with bitter lack of consideration like a slavedriver lashing a slave he spared no 
least shade of his cutting brush thus and thus and thus he seemed to say 
is it what do you think of this and this and this people came and 
stared young society matrons art dealers art critics the literary element who were interested in 
art some musicians and because the newspapers made especial mention of it quite a number 
of those who run wherever they imagine there is something interesting to see it was 
quite a notable two weeks' display miriam finch though she never admitted to eugene that 
she had seen itshe would not give him that satisfaction norma whitmore william mcconnell louis 
deesa owen overman paynter stone the whole ruck and rabble of literary and artistic life 
came there were artists of great ability there whom eugene had never seen before it 
would have pleased him immensely if he had chanced to see several of the city's 
most distinguished social leaders looking at one time and another at his pictures all his 
observers were astonished at his virility curious as to his personality curious as to what 
motive or significance or point of view it might have the more eclectically cultured turned 
to the newspapers to see what the art critics would say of thishow they would 
label it because of the force of the work the dignity and critical judgment of 
kellner and son the fact that the public of its own instinct and volition was 
interested most of the criticisms were favorable one art publication connected with and representative of 
the conservative tendencies of a great publishing house denied the merit of the collection as 
a whole ridiculed the artist's insistence on shabby details as having artistic merit denied that 
he could draw accurately denied that he was a lover of pure beauty and accused 
him of having no higher ideal than that of desire to shock the current mass 
by painting brutal things brutally mr witla wrote this critic would no doubt be flattered 
if he were referred to as an american millet the brutal exaggeration of that painter's 
art would probably testify to him of his own merit he is mistaken the great

a strange and memorable scene in the great english city of manchester long ere the 
grey winter's morning struggled in through the crisp frosty airlong ere the first gleam of 
the coming day dulled the glare of the flaming gas jets the streets of the 
lancashire capital were all astir with bustling crowds and the silence of the night was 
broken by the ceaseless footfalls and the voices of hurrying throngs through the long dim 
streets and past the tall rows of silent houses the full tide of life eddied 
and poured in rapid current stout burghers closely muffled and staff in hand children grown 
prematurely old with the hard marks of vice already branded on their features young girls 
with flaunting ribbons and bold flushed faces palefaced operatives and strong men whose brawny limbs 
told of the titanic labours of the foundry the clerk from his desk the shopkeeper 
from his store the withered crone and the careless navvy swayed and struggled through the 
living mass and with them trooped the legions of want and vice and ignorance that 
burrow and fester in the foetid lanes and purlieus of the large british cities: from 
the dark alleys where misery and degradation for ever dwell and from reeking cellars and 
nameless haunts where the twin demons of alcohol and crime rule supreme from the ginpalace 
and the beershop and the midnight haunts of the tramp and the burglar they came 
in all their repulsiveness and debasement with the rags of wretchedness upon their backs and 
the cries of profanity and obscenity upon their lips forward they rushed in a surging 
flood through many a street and byway until where the narrowing thoroughfares open into the 
space surrounding the new bailey prison in that suburb of the great city known as 
the borough of salford they found their further progress arrested between them and the massive 
prison walls rose piles of heavy barricading and the intervening space was black with a 
dense body of men all of whom faced the gloomy building beyond and each of 
whom carried a special constable's baton in his hand the long railway bridge running close 
by was occupied by a detachment of infantry and from the parapet of the frowning 
walls the muzzle of cannon trained on the space below might be dimly discerned in 
the darkness but the crowd paid little attention to these extraordinary appearances their eyes were 
riveted on the black projection which jutted from the prison wall and which shrouded in 
dark drapery loomed with ghastly significance through the haze rising above the scaffold which replaced 
a portion of the prison wall the outlines of a gibbet were descried and from 
the crossbeam there hung three ropes terminating in nooses just perceptible above the upper edge 
of the curtain which extended thence to the ground the grim excrescence seemed to possess 
a horrible fascination for the multitude those in position to see it best stirred not 
from their post but faced the fatal crosstree the motionless ropes the empty platform with 
an untiring insatiable gaze that seemed pregnant with some terrible meaning while the mob behind 
them struggled and pushed and raved and fought and the haggard hundreds of gaunt diseased 
stricken wretches that vainly contested with the stronger types of ruffianism for a place loaded 
the air with their blasphemies and imprecations the day broke slowly and doubtfully upon the 
scene a dense yellow murky fog floated round the spot wrapping in its opaque folds 
the hideous gallows and the frowning mass of masonry behind an hour passed and then 
a hoarse murmur swelled upwards from the glistening rows of upturned faces the platform was 
no longer empty three pinioned men with white caps drawn closely over their faces were 
standing upon the drop for a moment the crowd was awed into stillness for a 
moment the responses christ have mercy on us christ have mercy on us were heard 
from the lips of the doomed men towards whom the sea of faces were turned 
then came a dull crash and the mob swayed backwards for an instant the drop 
had fallen and the victims were struggling in the throes of a horrible death the 
ropes jerked and swayed with the convulsive movements of the dying men a minute later 
and the vibrations ceasedthe end had come the swaying limbs fell rigid and stark and 
the souls of the strangled men had floated upwards from the cursed spotup from the 
hateful crowd and the sinladen atmosphereto the throne of the god who made them\ so 
perished in the bloom of manhood and the flower of their strength three gallant sons 
of irelandso passed away the last of the martyred band whose blood has sanctified the 
cause of irish freedom far from the friends whom they loved far from the land 
for which they suffered with the scarletclad hirelings of england around them and watched by 
the wolfish eyes of a brutal mob who thirsted to see them die the dauntless 
patriots who in our own day have rivalled the heroism and shared the fate of 
tone emmett and fitzgerald looked their last upon the world no prayer was breathed for 
their parting soulsno eye was moistened with regret amongst the multitude that stretched away in 
compact bodies from the foot of the gallows the ribald laugh and the blasphemous oath 
united with their dying breath and callously as the roman mob from the bloodstained amphitheatre 
the english masses turned homewards from the fatal spot but they did not fall unhonoured 
or unwept in the churches of the faithful in that same city the sobs of 
mournful lamentation were mingled with the solemn prayers for their eternal rest and from thousands 
of wailing women and strickenhearted men the prayers for mercy peace and pardon for the 
souls of michael o'brien william philip allen and michael larkin rose upwards to the avenging 
god still less were they forgotten at home throughout the irish land from antrim's rocky 
coast to the foambeaten headlands of cork the hearts of their countrymen were convulsed with 
passionate grief and indignation and blended with the sharp cry of agony that broke from 
the nation's lips came the murmurs of defiant hatred and the pledges of a bitter 
vengeance never for generations had the minds of the irish people been more profoundly agitatednever 
had they writhed in such bitterness and agony of soul with knitted brows and burning 
cheeks the tidings of the bloody deed were listened to the names of the martyred 
men were upon every lip and the story of their heroism and tragic death was 
read with throbbing pulse and kindling eyes by every fireside in the land it is 
to assist in perpetuating that story and in recording for future generations the narrative which 
tells of how allen o'brien and larkin died that this narrative is written and few 
outside the nation whose hands are red with their blood will deny that at least 
so much recognition is due to their courage their patriotism and their fidelity in ireland 
we know it will be welcomed amongst a people by whom chivalry and patriotism are 
honoured a story so touching and so enobling will not be despised and the race 
which guards with reverence and devotion the memories of tone and emmett and the shearses 
will not soon surrender to oblivion the memory of the three truehearted patriots who heedless 
of the scowling mob unawed by the hangman's grasp died bravely that saturday morning at 
manchester for the good old cause of ireland\ early before daybreak on the morning of 
november th the policemen on duty in oakstreet manchester noticed four broadshouldered muscular men loitering 
in a suspicious manner about the shop of a clothes dealer in the neighbourhood some 
remarks dropped by one of the party reaching the ears of the policemen strengthened their 
impression that an illegal enterprise was on foot and the arrest of the supposed burglars 
was resolved on a struggle ensued during which two of the suspects succeeded in escaping 
but the remaining pair after offering a determined resistance were overpowered and carried off to 
the police station the prisoners who on being searched were found to possess loaded revolvers 
on their persons gave their names as martin williams and john whyte and were charged 
under the vagrancy act before one of the city magistrates they declared themselves american citizens 
and claimed their discharge williams said he was a bookbinder out of work whyte described 
himself as a hatter living on the means brought with him from america the magistrate 
was about disposing summarily of the case by sentencing the men to a few days' 
imprisonment when a detective officer applied for a remand on the ground that he had 
reason to believe the prisoners were connected with the fenian conspiracy the application was granted 
and before many hours had elapsed it was ascertained that martin williams was no other 
than colonel thomas j kelly one of the most prominent of the o'mahonystephens fenian leaders 
and that john whyte was a brother officer and coconspirator known to the circles of 
the fenian brotherhood as captain deasey\ of the men who had thus fallen into the 
clutches of the british government the public had already heard much and one of them 
was widely known for the persistency with which he laboured as an organiser of fenianism 
and the daring and skill which he exhibited in the pursuit of his dangerous undertaking 
long before the escape of james stephens from richmond bridewell startled the government from its 
visions of security and swelled the breasts of their disaffected subjects in ireland with rekindled 
hopes colonel kelly was known in the fenian ranks as an intimate associate of the 
revolutionary chief when the arrest at fairfieldhouse deprived the organization of its crafty leader kelly 
was elected to the vacant post and he threw himself into the work with all 
the reckless energy of his nature if he could not be said to possess the 
mental ability or administrative capacity essential to the office he was at least gifted with 
a variety of other qualifications well calculated to recommend him to popularity amongst the desperate 
men with whom he was associated nor did he prove altogether unworthy of the confidence 
reposed in him it is now pretty well known that the successful plot for the 
liberation of james stephens was executed under the personal supervision of colonel kelly and that 
he was one of the group of friends who grasped the hand of the head 
centre within the gates of eichmond prison on that night in november ' when the 
doors of his dungeon were thrown open kelly fled with stephens to paris and thence 
to america where he remained attached to the section of the brotherhood which recognised the 
authority and obeyed the mandates of the coir but the time came when even colonel 
kelly and his party discovered that stephens was unworthy of their confidence the chief whom 
they had so long trusted and whose oath to fight on irish soil before january 
' they had seen so unblushingly violated was deposed by the last section of his 
adherents and colonel kelly was elected deputy central organiser of the irish republic on the 
distinct understanding that he was to follow out the policy which stephens had shrunk from 
pursuing kelly accepted the post and devoted himself earnestly to the work in america he 
met with comparatively little cooperation the bulk of the irish nationalists in that country had 
long ranged themselves under the leadership of colonel wr roberts an irish gentleman of character 
and integrity who became the president of the reconstituted organization and the plans and promises 
of the chathamstreet wing as the branch of the brotherhood which ratified colonel kelly's election 
was termed were regarded for the most part with suspicion and disfavour but from ireland 
there came evidences of a different state of feeling breathless envoys arrived almost weekly in 
new york declaring that the fenian brotherhood in ireland were burning for the fraythat they 
awaited the landing of colonel kelly with feverish impatiencethat it would be impossible to restrain 
them much longer from fightingand that the arrival of the military leaders whom america was 
expected to supply would be the signal for a general uprising encouraged by representations like 
these colonel kelly and a chosen body of irishamerican officers departed for ireland in january 
and set themselves on their arrival in the old country to arrange the plans of 
the impending outbreak how their labours eventuated and how the fenian insurrection of march ' 
resulted it is unnecessary to explain it is enough for our purpose to state that 
for several months after that illstarred movement was crushed colonel kelly continued to reside in 
dublin moving about with an absence of disguise and a disregard for concealment which astonished 
his confederates but which perhaps contributed in no slight degree to the success with which 
he eluded the efforts directed towards his capture at length the fenian organization in ireland 
began to pass through the same changes that had given it new leaders and fresh 
vitality in america the members of the organization at home began to long for union 
with the irish nationalists who formed the branch of the confederacy regenerated under colonel roberts 
and kelly who for various reasons was unwilling to accept the new \f\i regime \f\i 
saw his adherents dwindle away until at length he found himself all but discarded by 
the fenian circles in dublin then he crossed over to manchester where he arrived but 
a few weeks previous to the date of his accidental arrest in oakstreet\ the arrest 
of colonel kelly and his aidedecamp as the english papers soon learned to describe deasey 
was hailed by the government with the deepest satisfaction for years they had seen their 
hosts of spies detectives and informers foiled and outwitted by this daring conspirator whose position 
in the fenian ranks they perfectly understood they had seen their traps evaded their bribes 
spurned and their plans defeated at every turn they knew too that kelly's success in 
escaping capture was filling his associates with pride and exultation and now at last they 
found the man whose apprehension they so anxiously desired a captive in their grasp on 
the other hand the arrests in oakstreet were felt to be a crushing blow to 
a failing cause by the fenian circles in manchester they saw that kelly's capture would 
dishearten every section of the organization they knew that the broad meaning of the occurrence 
was that another irish rebel had fallen into the clutches of the british government and 
was about to be added to the long list of their political victims it was 
felt by the irish in manchester that to abandon the prisoners helplessly to their fate 
would be regarded as an act of submission to the laws which rendered patriotism a 
crime and as an acceptance of the policy which left ireland trampled bleeding and impoverished 
there were hot spirits amongst the irish colony that dwelt in the great industrial capital 
which revolted from such a conclusion and there were warm impulsive hearts which swelled with 
a firm resolution to change the triumph of their british adversaries into disappointment and consternation 
the time has not yet come when anything like a description of the midnight meetings 
and secret councils which followed the arrest of colonel kelly in manchester can be written 
enough may be gathered however from the result to show that the plans of the 
conspirators were cleverly conceived and ably digested\ on wednesday september th colonel kelly and his 
companion were a second time placed in the dock of the manchester police office there 
is reason to believe that means had previously been found of acquainting them with the 
plans of their friends outside but this hypothesis is not necessary to explain the coolness 
and \f\i sang froid \f\i with which they listened to the proceedings before the magistrate 
hardly had the prisoners been put forward when the chief inspector of the manchester detective 
force interposed they were both he said connected with the fenian rising and warrants were 
out against them for treasonfelony williams he added with a triumphant air is colonel kelly 
and whyte his confederate is captain deasey he asked that they might again be remanded 
an application which was immediately granted the prisoners who imperturbably bowed to the detective as 
he identified them smilingly quitted the dock and were given in charge to police sergeant 
charles brett whose duty it was to convey them to the borough gaol\ the van 
used for the conveyance of prisoners between the police office and the gaol was one 
of the ordinary long black boxes on wheels dimly lit by a grating in the 
door and a couple of ventilators in the roof it was divided interiorly into a 
row of small cells at either side and a passage running the length of the 
van between and the practice was to lock each prisoner into a separate cell brett 
sitting in charge on a seat in the passage near the door the van was 
driven by a policeman another usually sat beside the driver on the box the whole 
escort thus consisting of three men carrying no other arms than their staves but it 
was felt that on the present occasion a stronger escort might be necessary the magistrates 
well knew that kelly and deasey had numerous sympathisers amongst the irish residents in manchester 
and their apprehensions were quickened by the receipt of a telegram from dublin castle and 
another from the home office in london warning them that a plot was on foot 
for the liberation of the prisoners the magistrates doubted the truth of the information but 
they took precautions nevertheless for the frustration of any such enterprise kelly and deasey were 
both handcuffed and locked in separate compartments of the van and instead of three policemen 
not less than twelve were entrusted with its defence of this body five sat on 
the boxseat two were stationed on the step behind four followed the van in a 
cab and one sergeant brett sat within the van the keys of which were handed 
in to him through the grating after the door had been locked by one of 
the policemen outside there were in all six persons in the van: one of these 
was a boy aged twelve who was being conveyed to a reformatory three were women 
convicted of misdemeanours and the two irishamericans completed the number only the lastmentioned pair were 
handcuffed and they were the only persons whom the constables thought necessary to lock up 
the compartments in which the other persons sat being left open\ at halfpast three o'clock 
the van drove off closely followed by the cab containing the balance of the escort 
its route lay through some of the principal streets then through the suburbs on the 
south side into the borough of salford where the county gaol is situated in all 
about two miles had to be traversed and of this distance the first half was 
accomplished without anything calculated to excite suspicion being observed but there was mischief brewing for 
all that and the crisis was close at hand just as the van passed under 
the railway arch that spans the hyderoad at bellevue a point midway between the city 
police office and the salford gaol the driver was suddenly startled by the apparition of 
a man standing in the middle of the road with a pistol aimed at his 
head and immediately the astonished policeman heard himself called upon in a loud sharp voice 
to pull up at the spot where this unwelcome interruption occurred there are but few 
houses brickfields and claypits stretch away at either side and the neighbourhood is thinly inhabited 
but its comparative quiet now gave way to a scene of bustle and excitement so 
strange that it seems to have almost paralysed the spectators with amazement the peremptory command 
levelled at the driver of the van was hardly uttered when a body of men 
numbering about thirty swarmed over the wall which lined the road and surrounding the van 
began to take effectual measures for stopping it the majority of them were welldressed men 
of powerful appearance a few carried pistols or revolvers in their hands and all seemed 
to act in accordance with a preconcerted plan the first impulse of the policemen in 
front appears to have been to drive through the crowd but a shot aimed in 
the direction of his head brought the driver tumbling from his seat terrorstricken but unhurt 
and almost at the same time the further progress of the van was effectually prevented 
by shooting one of the horses through the neck a scene of indescribable panic and 
confusion ensued the policemen scrambled hastily to the ground and betook themselves to flight almost 
without a thought of resistance those in the cab behind got out not to resist 
the attack but to help in running away and in a few minutes the strangers 
whose object had by this time become perfectly apparent were undisputed masters of the situation 
pickaxes hatchets hammers and crowbars were instantly produced and the van was besieged by a 
score stout pairs of arms under the blows from which its sides groaned and the 
door cracked and splintered some clambered upon the roof and attempted to smash it in 
with heavy stones others tried to force an opening through the side while the door 
was sturdily belaboured by another division of the band seeing the fenians as they at 
once considered them thus busily engaged the policemen who had in the first instance retreated 
to a safe distance and who were now reinforced by a large mob attracted to 
the spot by the report of firearms advanced towards the van with the intention of 
offering some resistance but the storming party immediately met them with a countermovement whilst the 
attempt to smash through the van was continued without pause a ring was formed round 
the men thus engaged by their confederates who pointing their pistols at the advancing crowd 
warned them as they valued their lives to keep off gaining courage from their rapidlyswelling 
numbers the mob however continued to close in round the van whereupon several shots were 
discharged by the fenians which had the effect of making the englishmen again fall back 
in confusion it is certain that these shots were discharged for no other purpose than 
that of frightening the crowd one of them did take effect in the heel of 
a bystander but in every other case the shots were fired high over the heads 
of the crowd while this had been passing around the van a more tragic scene 
was passing inside it from the moment the report of the first shot reached him 
sergeant brett seems to have divined the nature and object of the attack my god 
its these fenians he exclaimed the noise of the blows showered on the roof and 
sides of the van was increased by the shrieks of the female prisoners who rushed 
frantically into the passage and made the van resound with their wailings in the midst 
of the tumult a face appeared at the grating and brett heard himself summoned to 
give up the keys the assailants had discovered where they were kept and resolved on 
obtaining them as the speediest way of effecting their purpose give up the keys or 
they will shoot you exclaimed the women but brett refused the next instant he fell 
heavily backwards with the hot blood welling from a bulletwound in the head a shot 
fired into the keyhole for the purpose of blowing the lock to pieces had taken 
effect in his temple the terrorstricken women lifted him up screaming he's killed as they 
did so the voice which had been heard before called out to them through the 
ventilator to give up the keys one of the women then took them from the 
pocket of the dying policeman and handed them out through the trap the door was 
at once unlocked the terrified women rushed out and brett weltering in blood rolled out 
heavily upon the road then a palefaced young man wearing a light overcoat a blue 
tie and a tall brown hat who had been noticed taking a prominent part in 
the affray entered the van and unlocked the compartments in which kelly and deasey were 
confined a hasty greeting passed between them and then the trio hurriedly joined the band 
outside i told you kelly i would die before i parted with you cried the 
young man who had unlocked the doors then seizing kelly by the arm he helped 
him across the road and over the wall into the brickfields beyond here he was 
taken charge of by others of the party who hurried with him across the country 
while a similar office was performed for deasey who like colonel kelly found himself hampered 
to some extent by the handcuffs on his wrists the main body of those who 
had shared in the assault occupied themselves with preventing the fugitives from being pursued and 
not until kelly deasy and their conductors had passed far out of sight did they 
think of consulting their own safety at length when further resistance to the mob seemed 
useless and impossible they broke and fled some of them occasionally checking the pursuit by 
turning round and presenting pistols at those who followed many of the fugitives escaped but 
several others were surrounded and overtaken by the mob and now the chivalry of the 
english nature came out in its real colours no sooner did the cowardly set whom 
the sight of a revolver kept at bay while kelly was being liberated find themselves 
with some of the irish party in their power than they set themselves to beat 
them with savage ferocity the young fellow who had opened the van door and who 
had been overtaken by the mob was knocked down by a blow of a brick 
and then brutally kicked and stoned the only englishman who ventured to cry shame being 
himself assaulted for his display of humanity several others were similarly illtreated and not until 
the blood spouted out from the bruised and mangled bodies of the prostrate men did 
the valiant englishmen consider they had sufficiently tortured their helpless prisoners meanwhile large reinforcements appeared 
on the spot police and military were despatched in eager haste in pursuit of the 
fugitives the telegraph was called into requisition and a description of the liberated fenians flashed 
to the neighbouring towns the whole detective force of manchester was placed on their trail 
and in the course of a few hours thirtytwo irishmen were in custody charged with 
having assisted in the attack on the van but of kelly or deasey no trace 
was ever discovered they were seen to enter a cottage not far from the hyderoad 
and leave it with their hands unfettered but all attempts to trace their movements beyond 
this utterly failed while the authorities in manchester were excitedly discussing the means to be 
adopted in view of the extraordinary event brett lay expiring in the hospital to which 
he had been conveyed he never recovered consciousness after receiving the wound and he died 
in less than two hours after the fatal shot had been fired\ darkness had closed 
in around manchester before the startling occurrence that had taken place in their midst became 
known to the majority of its inhabitants swiftly the tidings flew throughout the big city 
till the whisper in which the rumour was first breathed swelled into a roar of 
astonishment and rage leaving their houses and leaving their work the people rushed into the 
streets and trooped towards the newspaper offices for information the rescue of colonel kelly and 
death of sergeant brett were described in thousands of conflicting narratives until the facts almost 
disappeared beneath the mass of inventions and exaggerations the creations of excitement and panic with 
which they were overloaded meanwhile the police maddened by resentment and agitation struck out wildly 
and blindly at the irish they might not be able to recapture the escaped fenian 
leaders but they could load the gaols with their countrymen and coreligionists they might not 
be able to apprehend the liberators of colonel kelly and captain deasey but they could 
glut their fury on members of the same nationality and this they did most effectually 
the whole night long the raid upon the irish quarter in manchester was continued houses 
were broken into and their occupants dragged off to prison and flung into cells chained 
as though they were raging beasts mere irish were set upon in the streets in 
the shops in their homes and hurried off to prison as if the very existence 
of the empire depended on their being subjected to every kind of brutal violence and 
indignity the yell for vengeance filled the air the cry for irish blood arose upon 
the nightair like a demoniacal chorus and before morning broke their fury was to some 
extent appeased by the knowledge that sixty of the proscribed racesixty of the hated irishwere 
lying chained within the prison cells of manchester\ fifteen minutes was the time occupied in 
setting kelly freeonly fifteen minutesbut during that short space of time an act was accomplished 
which shook the whole british empire to its foundation from the conspiracy to which this 
daring deed was traceable the english people had already received many startling surprises the liberation 
of james stephens and the shortlived insurrection that filled the snowcapped hills with hardy fugitives 
six months before had both occasioned deep excitement in england but nothing that fenianism had 
yet accomplished acted in the same bewildering manner on the english mind in the heart 
of one of their largest cities in the broad daylight openly and undisguisedly a band 
of irishmen had appeared in arms against the queen's authority and set the power and 
resources of the law at defiance they had rescued a coconspirator from the grasp of 
the government and slain an officer of the law in the pursuit of their object 
within a few minutes' walk of barracks and military dep\'tsin sight of the royal ensign 
that waved over hundreds of her majesty's defenders a prison van had been stopped and 
broken open and its defenders shot at and put to flight never had the english 
people heard of so audacious a proceedingnever did they feel more insulted from every corner 
of the land the cry swelled up for vengeance fierce and prompt victims there should 
be bloodirish bloodthe people \f\i would \f\i have nor were they willing to wait long 
for it it might be that falling in hot haste the sword of justice might 
strike the innocent and not the guilty it might be that in the thirst for 
vengeance the restraints of humanity would be forgotten but the english nature now thoroughly aroused 
cared little for such considerations it was irishmen who had defied and trampled on their 
power the whole irish people approved of the act and it mattered little who the 
objects of their fury might be provided they belonged to the detested race the prisoners 
huddled together in the manchester prisons with chains round their limbs might not be the 
liberators of colonel kellythe slayers of brett might not be amongst them but they were 
irishmen at any rate and so they would answer the purpose short shrift was the 
cry the ordinary forms of law the maxims of the constitution the rules of judicial 
procedure the proprieties of social order and civilization might be outraged and discarded but speedy 
vengeance should at all hazards be obtained: the hangman could not wait for his fee 
nor the people for their carnival of blood and so it was settled that instead 
of being tried at the ordinary commission in december a special commission should be issued 
on the spot for the trial of the accused\ on thursday the th of october 
the prisoners were brought up for committal before mr fowler rm and a bench of 
brother magistrates some of the irishmen arrested in the first instance had been dischargednot that 
no one could be found to swear against them a difficulty which never seems to 
have arisen in these cases but that the number of witnesses who could swear to 
their innocence was so great that an attempt to press for convictions in their cases 
would be pertain to jeopardize the whole proceedings the following is a list of the 
prisoners put forward the names being as afterwards appeared in many cases fictitious:\ william o'mara 
allen edward shore henry wilson william gould michael larkin patrick kelly charles moorhouse john brennan 
john bacon william martin john f nugent james sherry robert mcwilliams michael maguire thomas maguire 
michael morris michael bryan michael corcoran thomas ryan john carroll john cleeson michael kennedy john 
morris patrick kelly hugh foley patrick coffey thomas kelly and thomas scally\ it forms no 
part of our purpose to follow out the history of the proceedings in the manchester 
court on the th of september and the following days: but there are some circumstances 
in connection with that investigation which it would be impossible to pass over without comment 
it was on this occasion that the extraordinary sight of men being tried in chains 
was witnessed and that the representatives of the english crown came to sit in judgment 
on men still innocent in the eyes of the law yet manacled like convicted felons 
with the blistering irons clasped tight round their wrists the irish prisoners stood forward that 
justicesuch justice as tortures men first and tries them afterwardsmight be administered to them the 
police considered the precaution necessary urged the magistrate in reply to the scathing denunciations of 
the unprecedented outrage which fell from the lips of mr ernest jones one of the 
prisoners' counsel the police considered it necessary though within the courthouse no friend of the 
accused could dare to show his facethough the whole building bristled with military and with 
policemen with their revolvers ostentatiously displayednecessary though every approach to the courthouse was held by 
an armed guard and though every soldier in the whole city was standing to armsnecessary 
there in the heart of an english city with a dense population thirsting for the 
blood of the accused and when the danger seemed to be not that they might 
escape from custodya flight to the moon would be equally practicablebut that they might be 
butchered in cold blood by the angry english mob that scowled on them from the 
galleries of the court house and howled round the building in which they stood in 
vain did mr jones protest in scornful words against the brutal indignityin vain did he 
appeal to the spirit of british justice to ancient precedent and modern practicein vain did 
he inveigh against a proceeding which forbad the intercourse necessary between him and his clientsand 
in vain did he point out that the prisoners in the dock were guiltless and 
innocent men according to the theory of the law no arguments no expostulations would change 
the magistrate's decision amidst the applause of the cowardly set that represented the british public 
within the courthouse he insisted that the handcuffs should remain on and then mr jones 
taking the only course left to a man of spirit under the circumstances threw down 
his brief and indignantly quitted the desecrated justice hall fearing the consequences of leaving the 
prisoners utterly undefended mr cottingham the junior counsel for the defence refrained from following mr 
jones's example but he too protested loudly boldly and indignantly against the cowardly outrage worthy 
of the worst days of the french monarchy which his clients were being subjected to 
the whole investigation was in keeping with the spirit evinced by the bench the witnesses 
seemed to come for the special purpose of swearing pointblank against the hapless men in 
the dock no matter at what cost to truth and to take a fiendish pleasure 
in assisting in securing their condemnation one of the witnesses was sure the whole lot 
of them wanted to murder everyone who had any property another assured his interrogator in 
the dock that he would go to see him hanged and a third had no 
hesitation in acknowledging the attractions which the reward offered by the government possessed for his 
mind men and women young and old all seemed to be possessed of but the 
one ideato secure as much of the bloodmoney as possible and to do their best 
to bring the hated irish to the gallows of course an investigation under these circumstances 
could have but one ending and no one was surprised to learn at its conclusion 
that the whole of the resolute body of sternfaced men who manacled and suffering confronted 
their malignant accusers had been committed to stand their trial in hot haste for the 
crime of wilful murder\ of the men thus dealt with there are four with whose 
fate this narrative is closely connected and whose names are destined to be long remembered 
in ireland they have won for themselves by their courage constancy and patriotism a fame 
that will never die and through all future time they will rank beside the dauntless 
spirits that in days of darkness and disaster perished for the sacred cause of ireland 
great men learned men prominent men they were notthey were poor they were humble they 
were unknown they had no claim to the reputation of the warrior the scholar or 
the statesman but they laboured as they believed for the redemption of their country from 
bondage they risked their lives in a chivalrous attempt to rescue from captivity two men 
whom they regarded as innocent patriots and when the forfeit was claimed they bore themselves 
with the unwavering courage and singleheartedness of christian heroes their short and simple annals are 
easily written but their names are graven on the irish heart and their names and 
actions will be cherished in ireland when the monumental piles that mark the restingplaces of 
the wealthy and the proud have returned like the bodies laid beneath them to dust\ 
william philip allen was born near the town of tipperary in april before he was 
quite three years old his parents removed to bandon county cork where the father who 
professed the protestant religion received the appointment of bridewellkeeper as young allen grew up he 
evinced a remarkable aptitude for the acquirement of knowledge and his studious habits were well 
known to his playmates and companions he was a regular attendant at the local trainingschool 
for the education of teachers for the protestant schools of the parish but he also 
received instruction at the morning and evening schools conducted under catholic auspices in the same 
town he was not a wild boy but he was quick and impulsiveready to resent 
a wrong but equally ready to forgive one and his natural independence of spirit and 
manly disposition rendered him a favourite with all his acquaintances the influence and example of 
his father did not prevent him from casting a wistful eye towards the ancient faith 
his mother a good pious catholic whose warmest aspiration was to see her children in 
the fold of the true church encouraged this disposition by all the means in her 
power and the result of her pious care shortly became apparent a mission opened in 
the town by some catholic order of priests completed the good work which the prayers 
and the example of an affectionate mother had commenced and young allen after regularly attending 
the religious services and exercises of the mission became so much impressed with the truth 
of the lectures and sermons he had listened to that he formally renounced the alien 
religion and was received by the respected parish priest of the town into the bosom 
of the catholic church his only sister followed his example while his brothers four in 
number remained in the protestant communion the subject of our sketch was apprenticed to a 
respectable master carpenter and timber merchant in bandon but circumstances highly creditable to the young 
convert induced the severance of the connection before his period of apprenticeship was expired and 
we next find him working at his trade in cork where he remained for some 
six months after which he returned to bandon he next crossed over to manchester at 
the request of some near relatives living there subsequently he spent a few weeks in 
dublin where he worked as builder's clerk and finally he revisited manchester where he had 
made himself numerous friends it was in the summer of ' that allen last journeyed 
to manchester he was then little more than nineteen years old but there is reason 
to believe that he had long before become connected with the fenian conspiracy in his 
ardent temperament the seeds of patriotism took deep and firm root and the dangers of 
the enterprise to which the fenians were committed served only to give it a fresh 
claim upon his enthusiastic nature when colonel kelly quitted dublin and took up his quarters 
in manchester allen was one of his most trusted and intimate associates and when the 
prison door grated behind the fenian leader it was allen who roused his countrymen to 
the task of effecting his liberation allen had by this time grown into a comely 
young man of prepossessing appearance he was a little over the middle height well shaped 
without presenting the appearance of unusual strength and was always seen neatly and respectably dressed 
his face was pale and wore a thoughtful expression his features when in repose wearing 
an appearance of pensiveness approaching to melancholy his eyes were small the eyelids slightly marked 
a mass of dark hair clustered gracefully over a broad pale forehead while the absence 
of any beard gave him a peculiarly boyish appearance gentle and docile in his calmer 
moments when roused to action he was all fire and energy we have seen how 
he bore himself during the attack on the prison van for he it was whom 
so many witnesses identified as the palefaced young fellow who led the attack and whose 
prophetic assurance that he would die for him greeted colonel kelly on regaining his freedom 
during the magisterial investigation he bore himself firmly proudly and as the english papers would 
have it defiantly his glance never quailed during the trying ordeal the marks of the 
brutality of his cowardly captors were still upon him and the galling irons that bound 
his hands cut into his wrists but allen never winced for a moment and he 
listened to the evidence of the sordid crew who came to barter away his young 
life with resolute mien the triumph was with him out of the jaws of death 
he had rescued the leader whose freedom he considered essential to the success of a 
patriotic undertaking and he was satisfied to pay the cost of the venture he had 
set his foot upon the ploughshare and would not shrink from the ordeal which he 
had challenged\ amongst the crowd of manacled men committed for trial by the manchester magistrates 
not one presented a finer or more impressive exterior than michael o'brien set down in 
the list above given as michael gould standing in the dock he seemed the impersonation 
of vigorous manhood frank fearless and resolute with courage and truth imprinted on every feature 
he presented to the eye a perfect type of the brave soldier he was tall 
and wellproportioned and his broad shoulders and welldeveloped limbs told of physical strength in keeping 
with the firmness reflected in his face his gaze when it rested on the unfriendly 
countenances before him was firm and undrooping but a kindly light lit his hazel eyes 
and his features relaxed into a sympathising and encouraging expression as often as he glanced 
at allen who stood behind him or bent his gaxe upon any of his other 
fellowprisoners o'brien was born near ballymacoda county cork the birthplace of the illfated and heroic 
peter crowley his father rented a large farm in the same parish but the blight 
of the bad laws which are the curse of ireland fell upon him and in 
the year the o'briens were flung upon the world dispossessed of lands and home though 
they owed no man a penny at the time michael o'brien was apprenticed to a 
draper in youghal and earned during the period of his apprenticeship the respect and esteem 
of all who knew him he was quiet and gentlemanly in manners and his character 
for morality and good conduct was irreproachable having served out his time in youghal he 
went to cork and he spent some time as an assistant in one of the 
leading drapery establishments of that city he afterwards emigrated to america where some of his 
relatives were comfortably settled like many of the bravest of his fellowcountrymen the outbreak of 
the civil war kindled a military ardour within his bosom and o'brien found himself unable 
to resist the attractions which the soldier's career possessed for him his record throughout the 
war was highly honourable his bravery and good conduct won him speedy promotion and long 
before the termination of the conflict he had risen to the rank of lieutenant when 
his regiment was disbanded he recrossed the atlantic and returned to cork where he again 
obtained employment as assistant in one of the large commercial establishments here he remained until 
the night before the fenian rising when he suddenly disappeared and all further trace was 
lost of him until arrested for participation in the attack upon the prison van in 
manchester\ close by his side in the dock stood michael larkin an intelligentlooking man older 
looking than most of his fellowprisoners the following are a few facts relating to his 
humble history:\ he was writes a correspondent who knew him a native of the parish 
of lusmagh in the southwestern corner of the king's county where for many generations his 
ancestors have been residents on the cloghan castle estate then in the possession of the 
o'moore family and where several of his relatives still reside and was grandson to james 
quirke a welltodo farmer who was flogged and transported in ' for complicity in the 
rebellion of that time and whose name in this part of the country is remembered 
with pleasure and affection for his indomitable courage and perseverance in resisting the repeated allurements 
held out by the corrupt minions of the crown to induce him to become a 
traitor to his companions and his country but all their importunities were vain quirke steadily 
persevered in the principles of his gallant leader robert emmett larkin's father was a respectable 
tradesman carrying on his business for many years in his native parish he removed to 
parsonstown where he contrived to impart to his son michael a good english education and 
then taught him his own profession when michael had attained a thorough knowledge of his 
business he was employed till ' at parsonstown he then went to england to improve 
his condition and after some time he married and continued to work on industriously at 
his business till may ' when he visited his native country to receive the last 
benediction of his dying father he again returned to england with his wife and family 
to resume his employment after some time he was arrested for assisting to release two 
of his fellowcountrymen from bondage i cannot attempt to enumerate the many good qualities of 
the deceased patriot: the paternal affection exhibited from the earliest age the mildness and affability 
of manner good temper affectionate and inoffensive disposition his sobriety and good moral conductendeared him 
to all who had the pleasure and honour of his acquaintance throughout his whole life 
he was remarkable for his 'love of country' and expressions of sincere regret for the 
miserable condition of many of his countrymen were ever on his lips he was in 
the true sense of the idea a good son an affectionate husband and father and 
a sincere friend\ on monday october th the three irishmen whose lives we have glanced 
at were placed at the bar of the manchester assize court and formally placed on 
their trial for wilful murder with them were arraigned thomas maguire a private belonging to 
the royal marines who was on furlough in liverpool at the time of kelly's liberation 
and who was arrested merely because he happened to be an irishman and who though 
perfectly innocent of the whole transaction had been sworn against by numerous witnesses as a 
ringleader in the attack and edward o'meagher condon \f\i alias \f\i shore a finelooking irishamerican 
a citizen of the state of ohio against whom like his four companions true bills 
had been found by the grand jury it would take long to describe the paroxysms 
of excitement panic and agitation that raged in the english mind within the period that 
intervened between the committal of the prisoners and the date at which we are now 
arrived nothing was heard of but the fenians nothing was talked of but the diabolical 
plots and murderous designs they were said to be preparing the queen was to be 
shot at balmoral was to be burned down the armouries had been attacked the barracks 
were undermined the gas works were to be exploded the bank blown up the water 
poisoned nothing was too infernal or too wicked for the fenians and every hour brought 
some addition to the monstrous stock of canards north and south east and west the 
english people were in a ferment of anxious alarm and everywhere fenianism was cursed as 
an unholy thing to be cut from society as an ulcerous soreto be banned and 
loathed as a pestilencea foul creation with murder in its glare and the torch of 
the incendiary burning in its gory hand under these circumstances there was little chance that 
an unprejudiced jury could be empanelled for the trial of the irish prisoners and their 
counsel seeing the danger sought to avent it by a motion for the postponement of 
the trials the home secretary was memorialed on the subject and the application was renewed 
before the judges in court but the efforts to obtain justice were fruitless the blood 
of the british lion was up with bloodshot eyes and bristling mane he stood awaiting 
his prey and there was danger in trifling with his rage even special commissicns were 
voted slow and a cry arose for martial law lynch law or any law that 
would give the blood of the victims without hindrance or delay so the appeal for 
time was spurned the government was deaf to all remonstrance british bloodthirstiness carried the day 
and the trials proceeded without interruption\ we have not patience to rehearse calmly the story 
of these trials which will long remain the reproach of british lawyers we shall not 
probe the motives which led to the appointment of two such men as justice mellor 
and justice blackburne as judges of the commission but history will be at no loss 
to connect the selection with their peculiar character on the bench nor shall we analyze 
the speeches of the attorneygeneral and his colleagues in which the passions and prejudices of 
the jury were so dexterously appealed to the character of the evidence demands more study 
the witnesses consisted of the policemen present at the attack the prisoners who were locked 
with kelly and deasey in the van and the bystanders who saw the affray or 
assisted in stoning the prisoners before and after they were captured they swore with the 
utmost composure against the four prisoners allen was identified as one of the leaders and 
he it was whom most of the witnesses declared to have fired through the door 
on this point indeed as on many others there was confusion and contradiction in the 
evidence: some of the witnesses were sure it was o'brien fired through the door others 
were inclined to assign the leading part to condon but before the trial had gone 
far it seemed to be understood that allen was the man to whom the death 
of brett was to be attributed and that the business of the witnesses was to 
connect the other prisoners as closely as possible with his act on one point nearly 
all of the witnesses were agreedwhoever there might be any doubt about there could be 
none concerning maguire seven witnesses swore positively to having seen him assisting in breaking open 
the van and some of them even repeated the words which they said he addressed 
to them while thus engaged on the evening of friday november st the trials terminated 
it was past five o'clock when judge mellor concluded his charge the court was densely 
crowded and every eye was strained to mark the effect of the judge's words upon 
the countenances of the prisoners but they poor fellows quailed not as they heard the 
words which they knew would shortly be followed by a verdict consigning them to the 
scaffold throughout the long trial their courage had never flagged their spirits had never failed 
them for an instant maguire who had no real connection with the other four and 
who knew that the charge against him was a baseless concoction did indeed betray traces 
of anxiety and bewilderment as the trial progressed but allen o'brien larkin and condon went 
through the frightful ordeal with a heroic display of courage to which even the most 
malignant of their enemies have paid tribute\ the judge has done and now the jury 
turned from the box to consider their verdict an hour and twenty minutes they remained 
absent then their returning tread was heard the prisoners turned their eyes upwards maguire looked 
towards them half hopefully half appealingly from allen's glance nothing but defiance could be read 
larkin fixed his gaze on the foreman who held the fatal record in his hand 
with calm resolution while a quiet smile played round o'brien's lips as he turned to 
hear the expected words\ guilty the word is snatched up from the lips of the 
foreman of the jury and whispered through the court they were all guilty so said 
the jury and a murmur of applause came rolling back in response to the verdict 
guilty a few there were in that court upon whom the fatal words fell with 
the bitterness of death but the englishmen who filled the crowded gallery and passages exulted 
at the sound: the vengeance which they longed for was at hand\ the murmur died 
away the sobs that rose from the dark recesses where a few strickenhearted women had 
been permitted to stand were stifled and then amidst breathless silence the voice of the 
crown clerk was heard demanding if the prisoners had anything to say why sentence of 
death should not be pronounced on them\ the first to respond was allen a slight 
flush reddened his cheeks and his eyes lit up with the fire of enthusiasm and 
determination as advancing to the front of the dock he confronted the court and spoke 
in resolute tones as follows:\ my lords and gentlemenit is not my intention to occupy 
much of your time in answering your question your question is one that can be 
easily asked but requires an answer which i am ignorant of abler and more eloquent 
men could not answer it where were the men who have stood in the dockburke 
emmett and others who have stood in the dock in defence of their country when 
the question was put what was their answer their answer was null and void how 
with your permission i will review a portion of the evidence that has been brought 
against me\ here mr justice blackburne interrupted it was too late he said to criticise 
the evidence and the court had neither the right nor the power to alter or 
review it if he added you have any reason to give why either upon technical 
or moral grounds the sentence should not be passed upon you we will hear it 
but it is too late for you to review the evidence to show that it 
was wrong\ cannot that be done in the morning sir asked allen who felt in 
his heart how easily the evidence on which he had been convicted might be torn 
to shreds but the judge said not no one he said could alter or review 
the evidence in any way after the verdict had been passed by the jury we 
can only he said in conclusion take the verdict as right and the only question 
for you is why judgment should not follow\ thus restricted in the scope of his 
observations the young felon proceeded to deliver the following patriotic and spirited address:\ no man 
in this court regrets the death of sergeant brett more than i do and i 
positively say in the presence of the almighty and everliving god that i am innocent 
aye as innocent as any man in this court i don't say this for the 
sake of mercy: i want no mercyi'll have no mercy i'll die as many thousands 
have died for the sake of their beloved land and in defence of it i 
will die proudly and triumphantly in defence of republican principles and the liberty of an 
oppressed and enslaved people is it possible we are asked why sentence should not be 
passed upon us on the evidence of prostitutes off the streets of manchester fellows out 
of work convicted felonsaye an irishman sentenced to be hung when an english dog would 
have got off i say positively and defiantly justice has not been done me since 
i was arrested if justice had been done me i would not have been handcuffed 
at the preliminary investigation in bridgestreet and in this court justice has not been done 
me in any shape or form i was brought up here and all the prisoners 
by my side were allowed to wear overcoats and i was told to take mine 
off what is the principle of that there was something in that principle and i 
say positively that justice has not been done me as for the other prisoners they 
can speak for themselves with regard to that matter and now with regard to the 
way i have been identified i have to say that my clothes were kept for 
four hours by the policemen in fairfieldstation and shown to parties to identify me as 
being one of the perpetrators of this outrage on hyderoad also in albertstation there was 
a handkerchief kept on my head the whole night so that i could be identified 
the next morning in the corridor by the witnesses i was ordered to leave on 
the handkerchief for the purpose that the witnesses could more plainly see i was one 
of the parties who committed the outrage as for myself i feel the righteousness of 
my every art with regard to what i have done in defence of my country 
i fear not i am fearlessfearless of the punishment that can be inflicted on me 
and with that my lords i have done after a moment's pausei beg to be 
excused one remark more i return mr seymour and mr jones my sincere and heartfelt 
thanks for their able eloquence and advocacy on my part in this affair i wish 
also to return to mr roberts the very same my name sir might be wished 
to be known it is not william o'meara allen my name is william philip allen 
i was born and reared in bandon in the county of cork and from that 
place i take my name and i am proud of my country and proud of 
my parentage my lords i have done\ a sign of mingled applause and admiration rose 
faintly on the air as the gallant young irishman inclining his head slightly to the 
court retired to make way at the front of the bar for one of his 
companions in misfortune but his chivalrous bearing and noble words woke no response within the 
prejudicehardened hearts of the majority of his auditors they felt that the fearless words of 
the fearless youth would overbear all that his accusers had uttered and that the world 
would read in them the condemnation of the government and of the people whose power 
he so bravely defied\ michael larkin spoke next he looked a shade paler than on 
the first day of the trial but no want of resolution was expressed in his 
firmset face he gazed with an unquailing glance round the faces eagerly bent forward to 
catch his words and then spoke in distinct tones as follows:\ i have only got 
a word or two to say concerning serjeant brett as my friend here said no 
one could regret the man's death as much as i do with regard to the 
charge of pistols and revolvers and my using them i call my god as a 
witness that i neither used pistols revolvers nor any instrument on that day that would 
deprive the life of a child let alone a man nor did i go there 
on purpose to take life away certainly my lords i do not want to deny 
that i did go to give aid and assistance to those two noble heroes that 
were confined in that vankelly and deasey i did go to do as much as 
lay in my power to extricate them out of their bondage but i did not 
go to take life nor my lords did anyone else it is a misfortune there 
was life taken but if it was taken it was not done intentionally and the 
man who has taken life we have not got him i was at the scene 
of action when there were over i dare say people standing by there when i 
was i am very sorry i have to say my lord but i thought i 
had some respectable people to come up as witnesses against me but i am sorry 
to say as my friend said i will make no more remarks concerning that all 
i have to say my lords and gentlemen is that so far as my trial 
went and the way it was conducted i believe i have got a fair trial 
so far as my noble counsel went they done their utmost in the protection of 
my life likewise my worthy solicitor mr roberts has done his best but i believe 
as the old saying is a true one what is decreed a man in the 
page of life he has to fulfil either on the gallows drowning a fair death 
in bed or on the battlefield so i look to the mercy of god may 
god forgive all who have sworn my life away as i am a dying man 
i forgive them from the bottom of my heart god forgive them\ as larkin ceased 
speaking o'brien who stood to the right of him moved slightly in advance and intimated 
by a slight inclination to the court his intention of addressing them his stalwart form 
seemed to dilate with proud defiance and scorn as he faced the ermineclad dignitaries who 
were about to consign him to the gibbet he spoke with emphasis and in tones 
which seemed to borrow a something of the fire and spirit of his words he 
said:\ i shall commence by saying that every witness who has sworn anything against me 
has sworn falsely i have not had a stone in my possession since i was 
a boy i had no pistol in my possession on the day when it is 
alleged this outrage was committed you call it an outrage i don't i say further 
my name is michael o'brien i was born in the county of cork and have 
the honour to be a fellowparishioner of peter o'neal crowley who was fighting against the 
british troops at mitchelstown last march and who fell fighting against british tyranny in ireland 
i am a citizen of the united states of america and if charles francis adams 
had done his duty towards me as he ought to do in this country i 
would not be in this dock answering your questions now mr adams did not come 
though i wrote to him he did not come to see if i could not 
find evidence to disprove the charge which i positively could if he had taken the 
trouble of sending or coming to see what i could do i hope the american 
people will notice that part of the business [the prisoner here commenced reading from a 
paper he held in his hand] the right of man is freedom the great god 
has endowed him with affections that he may use not smother them and a world 
that may be enjoyed once a man is satisfied he is doing right and attempts 
to do anything with that conviction he must be willing to face all the consequences 
ireland with its beautiful scenery its delightful climate its rich and productive lands is capable 
of supporting more than treble its population in ease and comfort yet no man except 
a paid official of the british government can say there is a shadow of liberty 
that there is a spark of glad life amongst its plundered and persecuted inhabitants it 
is to be hoped that its imbecile and tyrannical rulers will be for ever driven 
from her soil amidst the execration of the world how beautifully the aristocrats of england 
moralise on the despotism of the rulers of italy and dahomeyin the case of naples 
with what indignation did they speak of the ruin of families by the detention of 
its head or some loved member in a prison who have not heard their condemnations 
of the tyranny that would compel honourable and good men to spend their useful lives 
in hopeless banishment\ the taunt went home to the hearts of his accusers and writhing 
under the lash thus boldly applied judge blackburne hastened to intervene unable to stay on 
\f\i legal grounds \f\i the torrent of scathing invective by which o'brien was driving the 
blood from the cheeks of his british listeners the judge resorted to a device which 
mr justice keogh had practised very adroitly and with much success at various of the 
state trials in ireland he appealed to the prisoner entirely for his own sake to 
cease his remarks the only possible effect of your observations he said must be to 
tell against you with those who have to consider the sentence i advise you to 
say nothing more of that sort i do so entirely for your own sake but 
o'brien was not the man to be cowed into submission by this artful representation possibly 
he discerned the motive of the interruption and estimated at its true value the disinterestedness 
of judge blackburne's advice mr ernest jones in vain used his influence to accomplish the 
judge's object o'brien spurned the treacherous bait and resolutely proceeded:\ they cannot find words to 
express their horror of the cruelties of the king of dahomey because he sacrificed human 
beings yearly but why don't those persons who pretend such virtuous indignation at the misgovernment 
of other countries look at home and see if greater crimes than those they charge 
against other governments are not committed by themselves or by their sanction let them look 
at london and see the thousands that want bread there while those aristocrats are rioting 
in luxuries and crimes look to ireland see the hundreds of thousands of its people 
in misery and want see the virtuous beautiful and industrious women who only a few 
years agoaye and yetare obliged to look at their children dying for want of food 
look at what is called the majesty of the law on one side and the 
long deep misery of a noble people on the other which are the young men 
of ireland to respectthe law that murders or banishes their people or the means to 
resist relentless tyranny and ending their miseries for ever under a home government i need 
not answer that question here i trust the irish people will answer it to their 
satisfaction soon i am not astonished at my conviction the government of this country have 
the power of convicting any person they appoint the judge they choose the jury and 
by means of what they call patronage which is the means of corruption they have 
the power of making the laws to suit their purposes i am confident that my 
blood will rise a hundredfold against the tyrants who think proper to commit such an 
outrage in the first place i say i was identified improperly by having chains on 
my hands and feet at the time of identification and thus the witnesses who have 
sworn to my throwing stones and firing a pistol have sworn to what is false 
for i was as those ladies said at the jail gates i thank my counsel 
for their able defence and also mr roberts for his attention to my case\ edward 
maguire spoke next he might well have felt bewildered at the situation in which he 
found himself but he spoke earnestly and collectedly nevertheless he had had an experience of 
british law which if not without precedent was still extraordinary enough to create amazement he 
knew that he had never been a fenian he knew that he never saw colonel 
kellynever heard of him until arrested for assisting in his liberation he knew that while 
the van was being attacked at bellevue he was sitting in his own home miles 
away and he knew that he had never in his life placed his foot in 
the scene of the rescue yet there he found himself convicted by regular process of 
law of the murder of constable brett he had seen witness after witness enter the 
box and deliberately swear they saw him take a prominent part in the rescue he 
saw policemen and civilians coolly identify him as a ringleader in the affair he had 
heard the crown lawyers weave round him the subtle meshes of their logic and now 
he found himself pronounced guilty by the jury in the teeth of the overwhelming array 
of unimpeachable evidence brought forward in his defence what the safeguards of the constitution meanwhat 
the bulwark of english freedom and the palladium of british freedom are worth when englishmen 
fill the jurybox and an irishman stands in the dock maguire had had a fair 
opportunity of judging had he been reflectively inclined he might too have found himself compelled 
to adopt a rather low estimate of the credibility of english witnesses when they get 
an opportunity of swearing away an irishman's life an impetuous man might have been goaded 
by the circumstances into cursing the atrocious system under which justice had been administered to 
him and calling down the vengeance of heaven on the whole nation from which the 
perjured wretches who swore away his life had been drawn but maguire acted more discreetly 
he began indeed by declaring that all the witnesses who swore against him were perjurersby 
vehemently protesting that the case as regarded him was one of mistaken identity but he 
shortly took surer ground by referring to his services in the navy and talking of 
his unfailing loyalty to his queen and his country he went through the record of 
his services as a marine appealed to the character he had obtained from his commanding 
officers in confirmation of his words: and concluded by solemnly protesting his perfect innocence of 
the charge on which he had been convicted\ while maguire's impressive words were still ringing 
in the ears of his consciencestricken accusers edward o'meagher condon commenced to speak he was 
evidently more of an orator than either of those who had preceded him and he 
spoke with remarkable fluency grace and vigour the subjoined is a correct report of his 
spirited and able address:\ my lordsthis has come upon me somewhat by surprise it appeared 
to me rather strange that upon any amount of evidence which of course was false 
a man could have been convicted of wilfully murdering others he never saw or heard 
of before he was put in prison i do not care to detain your lordships 
but i cannot help remarking that mr shaw who has come now to gloat upon 
his victims alter having sworn away their livesthat man has sworn what is altogether false 
and there are contradictions in the depositions which have not been brought before your lordships' 
notice i suppose the depositions being imperfect there was no necessity for it as to 
mr batty he swore at his first examination before the magistrates that a large stone 
fell on me a stone which mr roberts said at the time would have killed 
an elephant but not the slightest mark was found on my head and if i 
was to go round the country and him with me as exhibiting the stone having 
fallen on me and him as the man who would swear to it i do 
not know which would be looked for with the most earnestness however it has been 
accepted by the jury now he says he only thinks so there is another matter 
to consider i have been sworn to i believe by some of the witnesses who 
have also sworn to others though some of them can prove they were in another 
city altogetherin liverpool others have an overwhelming \f\i alibi \f\i and i should by right 
have been tried with them but i suppose your lordships cannot help that we have 
for instance thomas the policeman who swore to another prisoner he identified him on a 
certain day and the prisoner was not arrested for two days afterwards as for thomas 
i do not presume that any jury could have believed him he had heard of 
the bloodmoney and of course was prepared to bid pretty high for it my \f\i 
alibi \f\i has not been strong and unfortunately i was not strong in pocket and 
was not able to produce more testimony to prove where i was at exactly that 
time with regard to the unfortunate man who has lost his life i sympathize with 
him and his family as deeply as your lordships or the jury or anyone in 
the court i deeply regret the unfortunate occurrence but i am as perfectly innocent of 
his blood as any man i never had the slightest intention of taking life i 
have done nothing at all in connection with that man and i do not desire 
to be accused of a murder which i have not committed with regard to another 
matter my learned counsel has no doubt for the best expressed some opinions on these 
matters and the misgovernment to which my country has been subjected i am firmly convinced 
there is prejudice in the minds of the people and it has been increased and 
excited by the newspapers or by some of them and to a certain extent has 
influenced the minds of the jury to convict the men standing in this dock on 
a charge of whicha learned gentleman remarked a few nights sincethey would be acquitted if 
they had been charged with murdering an old woman for the sake of the money 
in her pocket but a political offence of this kind they could not now sir 
with regard to the opinions i hold on national matterswith regard to those men who 
have been released from that van in which unfortunately life was lost i am of 
opinion that certainly to some extent there was an excess perhaps it was unthought but 
if those men had been in other countries occupying other positionsif jefferson davis had been 
released in a northern city there would have been a cry of applause throughout all 
england if garibaldi who i saw before i was shut out from the world had 
been arrested was released or something of that kind had taken place they would have 
applauded the bravery of the act if the captives of king theodore had been released 
that too would have been applauded but as it happened to be in england of 
course it is an awful thing while yet in ireland murders are perpetrated on unoffending 
men as in the case of the riots in waterford where an unoffending man was 
murdered and no one was punished for it i do not desire to detain your 
lordships i can only say that i leave this world without a stain on my 
conscience that i have been wilfully guilty of anything in connexion with the death of 
sergeant brett i am totally guiltless i leave this world without malice to anyone i 
do not accuse the jury but i believe they were prejudiced i don't accuse them 
of wilfully wishing to convict but prejudice has induced them to convict when they otherwise 
would not have done with reference to the witnesses every one of them has sworn 
falsely i never threw a stone or fired a pistol i was never at the 
place as they have said it is all totally false but as i have to 
go before my god i forgive them they will be able to meet me some 
day before that god who is to judge us all and then they and the 
people in this court and everyone will know who tells the truth had i committed 
anything against the crown of england i would have scorned myself had i attempted to 
deny it but with regard to those men they have sworn what is altogether false 
had i been an englishman and arrested near the scene of that disturbance i would 
have been brought as a witness to identify them but being an irishman it was 
supposed my sympathy was with them and on suspicion of that sympathy i was arrested 
and in consequence of the arrest and the rewards which were offered i was identified 
it could not be otherwise as i said before my opinions on national matters do 
not at all relate to the case before your lordships we have been found guilty 
and as a matter of course we accept our death as gracefully as possible we 
are not afraid to dieat least i am not\ nor i nor i nor i 
swelled up from the lips of his companions and then with a proud smile condon 
continued:\ i have no sin or stain upon me and i leave this world at 
peace with all with regard to the other prisoners who are to be tried afterwards 
i hope our blood at least will satisfy the cravings for it i hope our 
blood will be enough and that those men who i honestly believe are guiltless of 
the blood of that manthat the other batches will get a fair free and a 
more impartial trial we view matters in a different light from what the jury do 
we have been imprisoned and have not had the advantage of understanding exactly to what 
this excitement has led i can only hope and pray that this prejudice will disappearthat 
my poor country will right herself some day and that her people so far from 
being looked upon with scorn and aversion will receive what they are entitled to the 
respect not only of the civilized world but of englishmen i too am an american 
citizen and on english territory i have committed no crime which makes me amenable to 
the crown of england i have done nothing and as a matter of course i 
did expect protectionas this gentleman pointing to allen has said the protection of the ambassador 
of my government i am a citizen of the state of ohio but i am 
sorry to say my name is not shore my name is edward o'meagher condon i 
belong to ohio and there are loving hearts there that will be sorry for this 
i have nothing but my best wishes to send them and my best feelings and 
assure them i can die as a christian and an irishman and that i am 
not ashamed or afraid of anything i have done or the consequences before god or 
man they would be ashamed of me if i was in the slightest degree a 
coward or concealed my opinions the unfortunate divisions of our countrymen in america have to 
a certain extent neutralized the efforts that we have made either in one direction or 
another for the liberation of our country all these things have been thwarted and as 
a matter of course we must only submit to our fate i only trust again 
that those who are to be tried after us will have a fair trial and 
that our blood will satisfy the craving which i understand exists you will soon send 
us before god and i am perfectly prepared to go i have nothing to regret 
or to retract or take back i can only say god save ireland\ again were 
the voices of his companions raised in unison god save ireland they cried defiantly in 
chorus god save ireland the cry rung through the packed justicehall and fell on the 
ears of its bloodthirsty occupants like the voice of an accusing angel god save ireland 
they said and then the bravehearted fellows gazed fiercely around the hostile gathering as if 
daring them to interfere with the prayer god save irelandfrom the few brokenhearted relatives who 
listened to the patriots' prayer the responsive amen was breathed back and the dauntless young 
irishman continued:\ i wish to add a word or two there is nothing in the 
close of my political career which i regret i don't know of one act which 
could bring the blush of shame to my face or make me afraid to meet 
my god or fellowman i would be most happy and nothing would give me greater 
pleasure than to die on the field for my country in defence of her liberty 
as it is i cannot die on the field but i can die on the 
scaffold i hope as a soldier a man and a christian\ and now the last 
was spoken as true irishmen and as true patriots they had borne themselves no trace 
of flinching did they give for their enemies to gloat overno sign of weakness which 
could take from the effect of their deathless words with bold front and steady mien 
they stood forward to listen to the fatal decree their judges were ready to pronounce 
the judges produced the black caps with which they had come provided and then justice 
mellor proceeded to pass sentence no person he said who had witnessed the proceedings could 
doubt the propriety of the verdict which he insisted was the result of a full 
patient and impartial investigation he made no distinction i am perfectly convinced he said that 
all of you had resolved at any risk and by any amount of dangerous violence 
and outrage to accomplish your object and that in fact charles brett was murdered because 
it was essential to the completion of your common design that he should be the 
stereotyped words of exhortation to repentance followed and then the judge concluded:\ the sentence is 
that you and each of you be taken hence to the place whence you came 
and thence to a place of execution and that you be there hanged by the 
neck until you shall be dead and that your bodies be afterwards buried within the 
precincts of the prison wherein you were last confined after your respective convictions and may 
god in his infinite mercy have mercy upon you\ with quiet composure the doomed men 
heard the words they warmly shook hands with their counsel thanked them for their exertions 
and then looking towards the spot where their weeping friends were seated they turned to 
leave the dock god be with you irishmen and irishwomen they cried and as they 
disappeared from the court their final adieu was heard in the same prayer that had 
swelled upwards to heaven from them before\ god save ireland\ [illustration: god save ireland]\ scarcely 
had the manchester courthouse ceased to echo those voices from the dock when the glaring 
falseness of the verdict became the theme of comment amongst even the most thoroughgoing englishmen 
who had been present throughout the trial\ without more ado down sate some thirty or 
forty reporters who as representatives of the english metropolitan and provincial press had attended the 
commission and addressed a memorial to the home secretary stating that they had been long 
accustomed to attend at trials on capital charges that they had extensive experience of such 
cases from personal observation of prisoners in the dock and witnesses on the table and 
that they were solemnly convinced the swearing of the witnesses and the verdict of the 
jury to the contrary notwithstanding that the man maguire had neither hand act nor part 
in the crime for which he had been sentenced to death the following is the 
petition referred to:\ we the undersigned members of the metropolitan and provincial press having had 
long experience in courts of justice and full opportunity of observing the demeanour of prisoners 
and witnesses in cases of criminal procedure beg humbly to submit that having heard the 
evidence adduced before the special commission on the capital charge preferred against thomas maguire private 
in the royal marines we conscientiously believe that the said thomas maguire is innocent of 
the crime of which he has been convicted and that his conviction has resulted from 
mistaken identity we therefore pray that you will be pleased to advise her majesty to 
grant her most gracious pardon to the said thomas maguire\ this was a startling event 
it was a proceeding utterly without precedent nothing but the most extraordinary circumstances could have 
called it forth the blunder of the jury must have been open glaring painfully notorious 
indeed when such an astonishing course was adopted by the whole staff of the english 
press\ it was most embarrassing for what had those newspaper reporters seen or heard that 
the jurors had not seen and heardand yet the jurors said maguire was guilty what 
had those reporters seen or heard that the judges had not seen and heardand yet 
the judges said they fully concurred in the verdict of the jury the reporters were 
not sworn on the evangelists of god to give a true deliverancebut the jurors were 
the reporters were not sworn to administer justicewere not dressed in erminewere not bound to 
be men of legal ability judicial calmness wisdom and impartialitybut the judges were yet the 
unsworn reporters told the government maguire was an innocent man while judge and jury told 
the government \f\i swore \f\i to itthat he was a guilty murderer\ what was the 
government to do was it to act on the verdict of newspaper reporters who had 
happened to be present at this trial and not on the verdict of the jury 
who had been solemnly sworn in the case behind the reporters' verdict lay the huge 
sustaining power of almost universal conviction mysteriously felt and owned though as yet nowhere expressed 
everyone who had calmly and dispassionately weighed the evidence arrived at conclusions identical with those 
of the press jury and utterly opposed to those of the sworn jury the ministers 
themselvesit was a terribly embarassing truth to ownfelt that the reporters were as surely right 
as the jurors were surely wrong but what were they to do what a frightful 
imputation would public admission of that fact cast upon the twelve sworn jurorsupon the two 
judges what a damning imputation on their judgment or their impartiality was it to be 
admitted that newspaper reporters could be right in a case so awful where twelve sworn 
jurors and two judges were wrong\ and then look at the consequences the five men 
were convicted in the one verdict there were not five separate verdicts but one indivisible 
verdict if the jurors' verdict were publicly vitiatedif the government confessed or admitted that verdict 
to be falseit was not one man but five men who were affected by it 
to be sure the reporters' jury in \f\i their \f\i verdict did not include allen 
o'brien larkin and shore but was it to be conveyed by implication that omission from 
the reporters' verdict of acquittal was more fatal to a man than inclusion in the 
verdict of guilty by a sworn jury might not twenty or thirty or forty men 
quite as intelligent as the reporters be soon forthcoming to testify as forcibly of allen 
o'brien larkin and shore as the pressmen had testified of maguire was it only \f\i 
reporters \f\i whose judgment could set aside the verdict of sworn jurors endorsed by ermined 
judges but in any event the five men were convicted by the one verdict to 
cut that loosed allnot necessarily in law perhaps but inevitably as regarded public conscience and 
universal judgment for there was not in all the records of english jurisprudence a precedent 
for executing men on a verdict acknowledged to have been one of blunder or perjury 
clearly if the jurors were to be told by the government that in a case 
where life and death hung on the issue they had been so blinded by excitement 
passion or prejudice that they declared to be a guilty murderer a man whose innocence 
was patent even to unofficial lookerson in court the moral value of such a verdict 
was goneruined for ever and to hang \f\i anyone \f\i on such a verdict \f\i 
on that identical verdict thus blasted and abandoned \f\i would it was pointed out be 
murder for all its technical legality neither more nor less morally than cool deliberate coldblooded 
murder\ everybody saw this but everyone in england saw also the awkward difficulty of the 
case for to let allen o'brien larkin and shore go free of death in the 
face of their admitted complicity in the rescue would baulk the national demand for vengeance 
it was necessary that some one should be executed here were men who though they 
almost certainly had had no hand in causing even accidentally the death of brett dared 
to boast of their participation in the affray in the course of which that lamentable 
event unhappily occurredthat rescue which had so painfully wounded and humiliated english national pride if 
these men were saved from execution owing to any foolish scruples about hanging a possiblynay 
probablyinnocent man along with them a shout of rage would ascend from that virtuous nation 
amongst whom charlotte winsor the professional infantmurderess walks a free woman notwithstanding a jury's verdict 
of wilful murder and a judge's sentence of death\ so for a time it seemed 
that notwithstanding the verdict of the reporters the government would act upon the verdict of 
the jury and assume it to be correct no doubt maguire might be innocent but 
it was his misfortune to be included in an indivisible verdict with other men who 
though perhaps as guiltless as he of wilful murder were surely guilty of riot and 
rescue aggravated by the utterance of the most bitter reflections on the british constitution which 
all men know to be the envy of surrounding nations if they were not guilty 
of the crime laid against them on the trial they were guilty of something elsethey 
had outraged british pride it was necessary they should die and as maguire's verdict was 
not separate from theirs he must die too rather than that they should escape\ but 
after a while the idea gained ground in england that this would be rather \f\i 
too \f\i monstrous a proceeding maguire's utter innocence of any participation whatsoever in the rescue 
was too notorious the character of the witnesses on whose evidence he was convicted became 
known: some were thieves pickpockets or gaolbirds of some other denomination others were persons palpably 
confused by panic excitement passion or prejudice true these same witnesses were those who likewise 
swore against allen larkin o'brien and shore indeed a greater number swore against maguire than 
against some of the others nevertheless the overwhelming notoriety of the jury's blunder or perjury 
in at least his case became daily more and more an obstacle to his execution 
and eventually on the st of november it was announced that his conviction had been 
cancelled by the only means existing under the perfect laws of great britainnamely a free 
\f\i pardon \f\i for a crime never committed the prison doors were opened for maguire 
the sworn jurors were plainly told in effect that their blunder or perjury had wellnigh 
done the murder of at least one innocent man the judges were in like manner 
told that shorthandwriters had been more clearheaded or dispassionate to weigh evidence and judge guilt 
than they the indivisible verdict had been openly proclaimed worthless\ the news was received with 
a sense of relief in ireland where the wholesale recklessness of the swearing and the 
transparent falseness of the verdict had from the first created intense indignation and resentment everyone 
knew and saw that whatever might have been the participation of those men in the 
rescue of colonel kelly they had not had a fair trial nay that their socalled 
trial was an outrage on all law and justice that witnesses jurors and judges were 
in the full fierce heat of excitement panic and passionmuch more ready to swear evidence 
to find verdicts and to pass sentences against innocent men than they themselves were perhaps 
conscious of while labouring under such influences the public and official recognition of the falseness 
and injustice of the manchester verdict was therefore hailed with intense satisfaction\ maguire was at 
once liberated allen larkin shore and o'brien were still detained in custody it was universally 
concluded that notwithstanding the abandonment by the crown of the verdict on which they had 
been sentenced they because of their admitted complicity in the rescue would be held to 
imprisonmentprobably penal servitudefor a term of years considerable astonishment was excited some days subsequently to 
maguire's pardon by a statement that in the case of the other prisoners included in 
the verdict the law should take its course no one credited this declaration for an 
instant and most persons felt that the crown officials were indulging in an indecent piece 
of mockery amidst this universal incredulity howeverthis disdainful and indignant disbeliefthe prisoners' solicitor mr roberts 
vigilant and untiring to the last took the necessary steps to pray arrest of execution 
pending decision of the serious law points raised on the trial some of the most 
eminent counsel in england certified solemnly that these points were of the gravest nature and 
would in their opinion be fully established on argument before the judges in which event 
the conviction would be legally quashed independently of the substantial abandonment of it as false 
and untenable by the crown in maguire's case\ the first idea of the merest possibilitythe 
faintest chanceof the remaining four men being executed on the vitiated verdict arose when it 
became known that the judges or some of them had informally declared to the government 
without waiting to hear any argument on the subject that the points raised by the 
prisoners' counsel were not tenable or were not of force mr roberts was officially informed 
that the sentence would infallibly be carried out by this time barely a few days 
remained of the interval previous to the date fixed for the execution and the strangest 
sensations swayed the public mind in ireland even still no one would seriously credit that 
men would be put to death on a verdict notoriously false some persons who proposed 
memorials to the queen were met on all hands with the answer that it was 
all acting on the part of the government that even though it should be at 
the foot of the scaffold the men would be reprieved that the government would not 
\f\i dare not \f\i take away human life on a verdict already vitiated and abandoned 
as a perjury or blunder\ the day of doom approached and now as it came 
nearer and nearer a painful and sickening alternation of incredulity and horror surged through every 
irish heart meanwhile the press of england on both sides of the channel kept up 
a ceaseless cry for blood the government were told that to let these men off 
innocent or guilty would be weakness they were called upon to be firmthat is to 
hang first and reflect afterwards as the rd of november drew near the opinion began 
to gain ground even in england that things had been too hastily donethat the whole 
trial bore all the traces of panicand that if a few weeks were given for 
alarm and passion to calm down not a voice would approve the manchester verdict perceiving 
thisperceiving that time or opportunity for reflection or for the subsidence of panic would almost 
certainly snatch its prey from vengeancea deafening yell arose from the raving creatures of bloodhunger 
demanding that not a day not an hour not a second should be granted to 
the condemned\ still the irish people would not credit that far towards the close of 
the nineteenth century an act so dreadful durst be done\ during all this time the 
condemned lay in salford gaol tortured by the suspense inevitably created by maguire's reprieve although 
every effort was made by their friends to keep them from grasping at or indulging 
in hope the allsignificant fact of that release seemed to imperatively forbid the idea of 
their being executed on a verdict whose falseness was thus confessed the moment however that 
the singular conduct of the judges in london defeated the application of mr roberts they 
one and all resigned themselves to the worst and while their fellowcountrymen at home were 
still utterly and scornfully incredulous on the subject devoted their remaining hours exclusively to spiritual 
preparation for death upon the scaffold\ it was now that each character rushed to its 
index it was nowwithin the very shadow of deathin the most awful crisis that can 
test the soulthat these men rose into the grandeur and sublimity of true heroism they 
looked death in the face with serene and cheerful composure so far from requiring consolation 
it was they who strove most earnestly to console the grieving friends they were leaving 
behind imploring of them to exhibit resignation to the will of god and assuring them 
that ignominious as was death upon the gallows and terrible as was the idea of 
suffering such a fate unjustly it was not hard to die with a clear and 
tranquil conscience as they were dying for the cause of native land\ it may be 
questioned whether the martyrology of any nation in history can exhibit anything more noble more 
edifyingmore elevating and inspiringthan the last hours of these doomed irishmen their every thought their 
every utterance was full of tenderness and holinessfull of firmness and cheerful acceptance of god's 
will the farewell letters addressed by them to their relatives and friendsfrom which we take 
a fewamply illustrate the truth of the foregoing observations here is o'brien's last letter to 
his brother:\ new bailey prison salford\ nov th \ my dear brotheri have been intending 
to write to you for some time but having seen a letter from a mr 
moore addressed to the governor of this prison and knowing from that that you must 
be in a disagreeable state of suspense i may therefore let you know how i 
am at once with reference to the trial and all connected with it it was 
unfair from beginning to end and if i should die in consequence it will injure 
my murderers more than it will injure me why should i fear to die innocent 
as i am of the charge which a prejudiced jury assisted by perjured witnesses found 
me guilty of i will do judge and jury the justice of saying they believed 
me guilty of beinga citizen of the united states a friend to liberty a hater 
of relentless cruelty and therefore no friend to the british government as it exists in 
our beautiful island i must say though much i would like to live that i 
cannot regret dying in the cause of liberty and ireland it has been made dear 
to me by the sufferings of its people by the martyrdom and exile of its 
best and noblest sons the priest the scholar the soldier the saint have suffered and 
died proudly nobly: and why should i shrink from death in a cause made holy 
and glorious by the numbers of its martyrs and the heroism of its supporters as 
well as by its justice you don't and never shall forget that peter o'neill crowley 
died only a short time since in this cause\ far dearer the grave or the 
prison illum'd by one patriot name than the trophies of all who have risen on 
liberty's ruins to fame\ i should feel ashamed of my manhood if i thought myself 
capable of doing anything mean to save my life to get out of here or 
for any other selfish purpose let no man think a cause is lost because some 
suffer for it it is only a proof that those who suffer are in earnest 
and should be an incentive to others to be equally soto do their duty with 
firmness justice and disinterestedness \f\i i feel confident of the ultimate success of the irish 
cause as i do of my own existence \f\i god in his great mercy and 
goodness will strengthen the arm of the patriot and give him wisdom to free his 
country let us hope that he in his wisdom is only trying our patience the 
greater its sufferings the more glorious will he make the future of our unfortu i'll 
bring you a nice little sharkone that bites would you like that down in the 
atlantic ocean they have sharks that bite and bark they come up out of the 
water at night and bark like a dog oooh dear how funny giggled frieda and 
eugene began slowly rowing his boat lakeward be sure you bring me a nice fish 
she called be sure you're here to get it when i come back he answered 
he saw her with the lattice of spring leaves behind her the old house showing 
pleasantly on its rise of ground some housemartens turning in the morning sky what a 
lovely girl he thought she's beautifulas fresh as a flower that is the one great 
thing in the worldthe beauty of girlhood he came back after a time expecting to 
find her but her fostermother had sent her on an errand he felt a keen 
sense of disappointment there were other meetings after this once on a day when he 
came back practically fishless and she laughed at him once when he saw her sunning 
her hair on the back porch after she had washed it and she came down 
to stand under the trees near the water looking like a naiad he wished then 
he could take her in his arms but he was a little uncertain of her 
and of himself once she came to his studio in the barn to bring him 
a piece of leftover dough which his mother had turned on the top of the 
stove eugene used to be crazy about that when he was a boy his mother 
had remarked oh let me take it to him said frieda gaily gleeful over the 
idea of the adventure that's a good idea said angela innocently wait i'll put it 
on this saucer frieda took it and ran she found eugene staring oddly at his 
canvas his face curiously dark when her head came above the loft floor his expression 
changed immediately his guileless kindly smile returned guess what she said pulling a little white 
apron she had on over the dish strawberries they were in season oh no peaches 
and cream where would we get peaches now at the grocery store i'll give you 
one more guess angel cake he was fond of that and angela occasionally made it 
your guesses are all gone you can't have any he reached out his hand but 
she drew back he followed and she laughed no no you can't have any now 
he caught her soft arm and drew her close to him sure i can't their 
faces were close together she looked into his eyes for a moment then dropped her 
lashes eugene's brain swirled with the sense of her beauty it was the old talisman 
he covered her sweet lips with his own and she yielded feverishly there now eat 
your dough she exclaimed when he let her go pushing it shamefacedly toward him she 
was flusteredso much so that she failed to jest about it what would mrs witla 
think she added if she could see us eugene paused solemnly and listened he was 
afraid of angela i've always liked this stuff ever since i was a boy he 
said in an offhand way so your mother said replied frieda somewhat recovered let me 
see what you're painting she came round to his side and he took her hand 
i'll have to go now she said wisely they'll be expecting me back eugene speculated 
on the intelligence of girlsat least on that of those he liked somehow they were 
all wise under these circumstancescautious he could see that instinctively frieda was prepared to protect 
him and herself she did not appear to be suffering from any shock from this 
revelation rather she was inclined to make the best of it he folded her in 
his arms again you're the angel cake and the strawberries and the peaches and cream 
he said don't she pleaded don't i have to go now and when he released 
her she ran quickly down the stairs giving him a swift parting smile so frieda 
was added to the list of his conquests and he pondered over it gravely if 
angela could have seen this scene what a storm there would have been if she 
ever became conscious of what was going on what a period of wrath there would 
be it would be terrible after her recent discovery of his letters he hated to 
think of that still this bliss of caressing youthwas it not worth any price to 
have a bright joyous girl of eighteen put her arms about youcould you risk too 
much for it the world said one life one love could he accede to that 
could any one woman satisfy him could frieda if he had her he did not 
know he did not care to think about it only this walking in a garden 
of flowershow delicious it was this having a rose to your lips angela saw nothing 
of this attraction for some time she was not prepared yet to believe poor little 
depender on the conventions as she understood them that the world was full of plots 
and counterplots snares pitfalls and gins the way of the faithful and wellmeaning woman in 
marriage should be simple and easy she should not be harassed by uncertainty of affection 
infelicities of temper indifference or infidelity if she worked hard as angela was trying to 
do trying to be a good wife saving serving making a sacrifice of her time 
and services and moods and wishes for her husband's sake why shouldn't he do the 
same for her she knew of no double standard of virtue if she had she 
would not have believed in it her parents had raised her to see marriage in 
a different light her father was faithful to her mother eugene's father was faithful to 
his wifethat was perfectly plain her brothersinlaw were faithful to her sisters eugene's brothersinlaw were 
faithful to his sisters why should not eugene be faithful to her so far of 
course she had no evidence to the contrary he probably was faithful and would remain 
so he had said so but this prematrimonial philandering of his looked very curious it 
was an astonishing thing that he could have deceived her so she would never forget 
it he was a genius to be sure the world was waiting to hear what 
he had to say he was a great man and should associate with great men 
or failing that should not want to associate with anyone at all it was ridiculous 
for him to be running around after silly women she thought of this and decided 
to do her best to prevent it the seat of the mighty was in her 
estimation the place for eugene with her in the foreground as a faithful and conspicuous 
acolyte swinging the censer of praise and delight the days went on and various little 
meetingssome accidental some premeditatedtook place between eugene and frieda there was one afternoon when he 
was at his sister's and she came there to get a pattern for her fostermother 
from sylvia she lingered for over an hour during which time eugene had opportunities to 
kiss her a dozen times the beauty of her eyes and her smile haunted him 
after she was gone there was another time when he saw her at dusk near 
his boathouse and kissed her in the shadow of the sheltering grapearbor in his own 
home there were clandestine moments and in his studio the barn loft for frieda made 
occasion a few times to come to hima promise to make a sketch of her 
being the excuse angela resented this but she could not prevent it in the main 
frieda exhibited that curious patience in love which women so customarily exhibit and which a 
man can never understand she could wait for her own to come to herfor him 
to find her while he with that curious avidness of the male in love burned 
as a fed fire to see her he was jealous of the little innocent walks 
she took with boys she knew the fact that it was necessary for her to 
be away from him was a great deprivation the fact that he was married to 
angela was a horrible disaster he would look at angela when she was with him 
preventing him from his freedom in love with almost calculated hate in his eyes why 
had he married her as for frieda when she was near and he could not 
draw near her his eyes followed her movements with a yearning devouring glance he was 
fairly beside himself with anguish under the spell of her beauty frieda had no notion 
of the consuming flame she had engendered it was a simple thing to walk home 
with her from the postofficequite accidentally on several occasions it was a fortuitous thing that 
anna roth should invite angela and himself as well as his father and mother to 
her house to dinner on one occasion when frieda was visiting at the witla homestead 
angela thought frieda stepped away from eugene in a curiously disturbed manner when she came 
into the parlor she was not sure frieda hung round him in a goodnatured way 
most of the time when various members of the family were present she wondered if 
by any chance he was making love to her but she could not prove it 
she tried to watch them from then on but eugene was so subtle frieda so 
circumspect that she never did obtain any direct testimony nevertheless before they left alexandria there 
was a weeping scene over this hysterical tempestuous in which she accused him of making 
love to frieda he denying it stoutly if it wasn't for your relatives' sake she 
declared i would accuse her to her face here before your eyes she couldn't dare 
deny it oh you're crazy said eugene you're the most suspicious woman i ever knew 
good lord can't i look at a woman any more this little girl can't i 
even be nice to her nice to her nice to her i know how you're 
nice to her i can see i can feel oh god why can't you give 
me a faithful husband oh cut it out demanded eugene defiantly you're always watching i 
can't turn around but you have your eye on me i can tell well you 
go ahead and watch that's all the good it will do you i'll give you 
some real reason for watching one of these days you make me tired oh hear 
how he talks to me moaned angela and we're only married one year oh eugene 
how can you have you no pity no shame here in your own home too 
oh oh oh to eugene such hysterics were maddening he could not understand how anyone 
should want or find it possible to carry on in this fashion he was lying 
out of the whole cloth about frieda but angela didn't know and he knew she 
didn't know all these tantrums were based on suspicion if she would do this on 
a mere suspicion what would she not do when she had a proved cause still 
by her tears she as yet had the power of rousing his sympathies and awakening 
his sense of shame her sorrow made him slightly ashamed of his conduct or rather 
sorry for the tougher nature was constantly presenting itself her suspicions made the further pursuit 
of this love quest practically impossible secretly he already cursed the day he had married 
her for frieda's face was ever before him a haunting lure to love and desire 
in this hour life looked terribly sad to him he couldn't help feeling that all 
the perfect things one might seek or find were doomed to the searing breath of 
an inimical fate ashes of rosesthat was all life had to offer dead sea fruit 
turning to ashes upon the lips oh frieda frieda oh youth youth that there should 
dance before him for evermore an unattainable desirethe holy grail of beauty oh life oh 
death which was really better waking or sleeping if he could only have frieda now 
it would be worth living but without her chapter xv the weakness of eugene was 
that he was prone in each of these new conquests to see for the time 
being the sum and substance of bliss to rise rapidly in the scale of uncontrollable 
exaggerated affection until he felt that here and nowhere else now and in this particular 
form was ideal happiness he had been in love with stella with margaret with ruby 
with angela with christina and now with frieda quite in this way and it had 
taught him nothing as yet concerning love except that it was utterly delightful he wondered 
at times how it was that the formation of a particular face could work this 
spell there was plain magic in the curl of a lock of hair the whiteness 
or roundness of a forehead the shapeliness of a nose or ear the arched redness 
of fullblown petal lips the cheek the chin the eyein combination with these thingshow did 
they work this witchery the tragedies to which he laid himself open by yielding to 
these spellshe never stopped to think of them it is a question whether the human 
will of itself alone ever has cured or ever can cure any human weakness tendencies 
are subtle things they are involved in the chemistry of one's being and those who 
delve in the mysteries of biology frequently find that curious anomaly a form of minute 
animal life born to be the prey of another form of animal lifechemically and physically 
attracted to its own disaster thus to quote calkins some protozoa are apparently limited to 
special kinds of food the 'slipperanimal' paramecium and the 'bellanimal' vorticella live on certain kinds 
of bacteria and many others which live upon smaller protozoa seem to have a marked 
affinity for certain kinds i have watched one of these creatures actinobolus lie perfectly quiet 
while hundreds of bacteria and smaller kinds of protozoa bumped against it until a certain 
variety halteria grandinella came near when a minute dart or 'trochocyst' attached to a relatively 
long thread was launched the victim was invariably hit and after a short struggle was 
drawn in and devoured the results of many experiments indicate that the apparently willful selection 
in these cases is the inevitable action of definite chemical and physical laws which the 
individual organism can no more change than it can change the course of gravitation the 
killing dart mentioned above is called out by the particular kind of prey with the 
irresistible attraction of an iron filing for a magnet eugene did not know of these 
curious biologic experiments at this time but he suspected that these attractions were deeper than 
human will he thought at times that he ought to resist his impulses at other 
times he asked himself why if his treasure was in this and he lost it 
by resistance what had he a sense of personal purity it did not appeal to 
him the respect of his fellowcitizens he believed that most of his fellowcitizens were whited 
sepulchres what good did their hypocritical respect do him justice to others others were not 
concerned or should not be in the natural affinity which might manifest itself between two 
people that was for them to settle besides there was very little justice in the 
world as for his wifewell he had given her his word but he had not 
done so willingly might one swear eternal fealty and abide by it when the very 
essence of nature was lack of fealty inconsiderateness destruction change a gloomy hamlet to be 
sure asking can honor set a lega subtle machiavelli believing that might made right sure 
that it was a matter of careful planning not ethics which brought success in this 
world and yet one of the poorest planners in it an anarchistic manifestation of selfishness 
surely but his additional plea was that he did not make his own mind nor 
his emotions nor anything else and worst of all he counselled himself that he was 
not seizing anything ruthlessly he was merely accepting that which was thrust temptingly before him 
by fate hypnotic spells of this character like contagion and fever have their period of 
duration their beginning climax and end it is written that love is deathless but this 
was not written of the body nor does it concern the fevers of desire the 
marriage of true minds to which shakespeare would admit no impediment is of a different 
texture and has little sex in it the friendship of damon and pythias was a 
marriage in the best sense though it concerned two men the possibilities of intellectual union 
between a man and a woman are quite the same this is deathless in so 
far as it reflects the spiritual ideals of the universenot more so all else is 
illusion of short duration and vanishes in thin air when the time came for eugene 
to leave alexandria as he had originally wanted to do he was not at all 
anxious to depart rather it was an occasion of great suffering for him he could 
not see any solution to the problem which confronted him in connection with frieda's love 
for him as a matter of fact when he thought about it at all he 
was quite sure that she did not understand or appreciate the nature of her affection 
for him or his for her it had no basis in responsibility it was one 
of those things born of thin airsunlight bright waters the reflection of a bright roomthings 
which are intangible and insubstantial eugene was not one who if he thought anything at 
all about it would persuade a girl to immorality for the mere sake of indulgence 
his feelings were invariably compounded of finer things love of companionship love of beauty a 
variable sense of the consequences which must ensue not so much to him as to 
her though he took himself into consideration if she were not already experienced and he 
had no method of protecting her if he could not take her as his wife 
or give her the advantages of his presence and financial support secretly or openly if 
he could not keep all their transactions a secret from the world he was inclined 
to hesitate he did not want to do anything rashas much for her sake as 
for his in this case the fact that he could not marry her that he 
could not reasonably run away with her seeing that he was mentally sick and of 
uncertain financial condition the fact that he was surrounded by home conditions which made it 
of the greatest importance that he should conduct himself circumspectly weighed greatly with him nevertheless 
a tragedy could easily have resulted here if frieda had been of a headstrong unthinking 
nature if angela had been less watchful morbid appealing in her mood if the family 
and town conditions had been less weighty if eugene had had health and ample means 
he would probably have deserted angela taken frieda to some european cityhe dreamed of paris 
in this connectionand found himself confronted later by an angry father or a growing realization 
that frieda's personal charms were not the sum and substance of his existence or both 
george roth for all he was a traveling salesman was a man of considerable determination 
he might readily have ended the life of his daughter's betrayerart reputation or no he 
worshiped frieda as the living image of his dead wife and at best he would 
have been heartbroken as it was there was not much chance of this for eugene 
was not rash he was too philosophic conditions might have arisen in which he would 
have shown the most foolhardy bravado but not in his present state there was not 
sufficient anguish in his own existence to drive him to action he saw no clear 
way so in june with angela he took his departure for blackwood pretending to her 
outward indifference as to his departure but inwardly feeling as though his whole life were 
coming to nothing when he reached blackwood he was now naturally disgusted with the whole 
atmosphere of it frieda was not there alexandria from having been the most wearisome sidepool 
of aimless inactivity had suddenly taken on all the characteristics of paradise the little lakes 
the quiet streets the court house square his sister's home frieda's home his own home 
had been once more invested for him with the radiance of romancethat intangible glory of 
feeling which can have no existence outside the illusion of love frieda's face was everywhere 
in it her form the look of her eyes he could see nothing there now 
save the glory of frieda it was as though the hard weary face of a 
barren landscape were suddenly bathed in the soft effulgence of a midnight moon as for 
blackwood it was as lovely as ever but he could not see it the fact 
that his attitude had changed toward angela for the time being made all the difference 
he did not really hate herhe told himself that she was not any different from 
that she had been that was perfectly plain the difference was in him he really 
could not be madly in love with two people at once he had entertained joint 
affections for angela and ruby and angela and christina but those were not the dominating 
fevers which this seemed to be he could not for the time get the face 
of this girl out of his mind he was sorry for angela at moments then 
because of her insistence on his presence with heron her being in his company following 
him around as he put it he hated her dear heaven if he could only 
be free without injuring her if he could only get loose think at this moment 
he might be with frieda walking in the sun somewhere rowing on the lake at 
alexandria holding her in his arms he would never forget how she looked the first 
morning she came into his barn studio at homehow enticing she was the first night 
he saw her at sylvia's what a rotten mess living was anyhow and so he 
sat about in the hammock at the blue homestead or swung in a swing that 
old jotham had since put up for marietta's beaux or dreamed in a chair in 
the shade of the house reading he was dreary and lonely with just one ambition 
in the worldfrieda meanwhile as might be expected his health was not getting any better 
instead of curing himself of those purely carnal expressions of passion which characterized his life 
with angela the latter went on unbroken one would have thought that his passion for 
frieda would have interrupted this but the presence of angela the comparatively enforced contact her 
insistence on his attentions broke down again and again the protecting barrier of distaste had 
he been alone he would have led a chaste life until some new and available 
infatuation seized him as it was there was no refuge either from himself or angela 
and the at times almost nauseating relationship went on and on those of the blue 
family who were in the home or near it were delighted to see him the 
fact that he had achieved such a great success as the papers had reported with 
his first exhibition and had not lost ground with the seconda very interesting letter had 
come from m charles saying that the paris pictures would be shown in paris in 
julygave them a great estimate of him angela was a veritable queen in this home 
atmosphere and as for eugene he was given the privilege of all geniuses to do 
as he pleased on this occasion eugene was the centre of interest though he appeared 
not to be for his four solid western brothersinlaw gave no indication that they thought 
he was unusual he was not their typebanker lawyer grain merchant and real estate dealerbut 
they felt proud of him just the same he was different and at the same 
time natural genial modest inclined to appear far more interested in their affairs than he 
really was he would listen by the hour to the details of their affairs political 
financial agricultural social the world was a curious compost to eugene and he was always 
anxious to find out how other people lived he loved a good story and while 
he rarely told one he made a splendid audience for those who did his eyes 
would sparkle and his whole face light with the joy of the humor he felt 
through all thisthe attention he was receiving the welcome he was made to feel the 
fact that his art interests were not yet dead the paris exhibition being the expiring 
breath of his original burst of force he was nevertheless feeling the downward trend of 
his affairs most keenly his mind was not right that was surely true his money 
affairs were getting worse not better for while he could hope for a few sales 
yet the paris pictures did not sell in new york he was not certain that 
this would be the case this homeward trip had cost him two hundred of his 
seventeen hundred dollars and there would be additional expenses if he went to chicago as 
he planned in the fall he could not live a single year on fifteen hundred 
dollarsscarcely more than six months and he could not paint or illustrate anything new in 
his present state additional sales of the pictures of the two original exhibitions must be 
effected in a reasonable length of time or he would find himself in hard straits 
meanwhile angela who had obtained such a high estimate of his future by her experience 
in new york and paris was beginning to enjoy herself again for after all in 
her judgment she seemed to be able to manage eugene very well he might have 
had some slight understanding with frieda rothit couldn't have been much or she would have 
seen it she thoughtbut she had managed to break it up eugene was cross naturally 
but that was due more to her quarreling than anything else these storms of feeling 
on her partnot always premeditatedseemed very essential eugene must be made to understand that he 
was married now that he could not look upon or run after girls as he 
had in the old days she was well aware that he was considerably younger than 
she was in temperament inclined to be exceedingly boyish and this was apt to cause 
trouble anywhere but if she watched over him kept his attention fixed on her everything 
would come out all right and then there were all these other delightful qualitieshis looks 
his genial manner his reputation his talent what a delightful thing it had become to 
announce herself as mrs eugene witla and how those who knew about him sat up 
big people were his friends artists admired him common homely everyday people thought he was 
nice and considerate and able and very worth while he was generally liked everywhere what 
more could one want angela knew nothing of his real thoughts for because of sympathy 
a secret sense of injustice toward her on his part a vigorous morbid impression of 
the injustice of life as a whole a desire to do things in a kindly 
or at least a secret and not brutal way he was led to pretend at 
all times that he really cared for her to pose as being comfortable and happy 
to lay all his moods to his inability to work angela who could not read 
him clearly saw nothing of this he was too subtle for her understanding at times 
she was living in a fool's paradise playing over a sleeping volcano he grew no 
better and by fall began to get the notion that he could do better by 
living in chicago his health would come back to him there perhaps he was terribly 
tired of blackwood the long treeshaded lawn was nothing to him now the little lake 
the stream the fields that he had rejoiced in at first were to a great 
extent a commonplace old jotham was a perpetual source of delight to him with his 
kindly stable enduring attitude toward things and his interesting comment on life and marietta entertained 
him with her wit her good nature her intuitive understanding but he could not be 
happy just talking to everyday normal stable people interesting and worthwhile as they might be 
the doing of simple things living a simple life was just now becoming irritating he 
must go to london parisdo things he couldn't loaf this way it mattered little that 
he could not work he must try this isolation was terrible there followed six months 
spent in chicago in which he painted not one picture that was satisfactory to him 
that was not messed into nothingness by changes and changes and changes there were then 
three months in the mountains of tennessee because someone told him of a wonderfully curative 
spring in a delightful valley where the spring came as a dream of color and 
the expense of living was next to nothing there were four months of summer in 
southern kentucky on a ridge where the air was cool and after that five months 
on the gulf of mexico at biloxi in mississippi because some comfortable people in kentucky 
and tennessee told angela of this delightful winter resort farther south all this time eugene's 
money the fifteen hundred dollars he had when he left blackwood several sums of two 
hundred one hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty realized from pictures sold in 
new york and paris during the fall and winter following his paris exhibition and two 
hundred which had come some months afterward from a fortuitous sale by m charles of 
one of his old new york views had been largely dissipated he still had five 
hundred dollars but with no pictures being sold and none painted he was in a 
bad way financially in so far as the future was concerned he could possibly return 
to alexandria with angela and live cheaply there for another six months but because of 
the frieda incident both he and she objected to it angela was afraid of frieda 
and was resolved that she would not go there so long as frieda was in 
the town and eugene was ashamed because of the light a return would throw on 
his fading art prospects blackwood was out of the question to him they had lived 
on her parents long enough if he did not get better he must soon give 
up this art idea entirely for he could not live on trying to paint he 
began to think that he was possessedobsessed of a deviland that some people were pursued 
by evil spirits fated by stars doomed from their birth to failure or accident how 
did the astrologer in new york know that he was to have four years of 
bad luck he had seen three of them already why did a man who read 
his palm in chicago once say that his hand showed two periods of disaster just 
as the new york astrologer had and that he was likely to alter the course 
of his life radically in the middle portion of it were there any fixed laws 
of being did any of the socalled naturalistic school of philosophers and scientists whom he 
had read know anything at all they were always talking about the fixed laws of 
the universethe unalterable laws of chemistry and physics why didn't chemistry or physics throw some 
light on his peculiar physical condition on the truthful prediction of the astrologer on the 
signs and portents which he had come to observe for himself as foretelling trouble or 
good fortune for himself if his left eye twitched he had observed of late he 
was going to have a quarrel with someoneinvariably angela if he found a penny or 
any money he was going to get money for every notification of a sale of 
a picture with the accompanying check had been preceded by the discovery of a coin 
somewhere: once a penny in state street chicago on a rainy daym charles wrote that 
a picture had been sold in paris for two hundred once a threecent piece of 
the old american issue in the dust of a road in tennesseem charles wrote that 
one of his old american views had brought one hundred and fifty once a penny 
in sands by the gulf in biloxianother notification of a sale so it went he 
found that when doors squeaked people were apt to get sick in the houses where 
they were and a black dog howling in front of a house was a sure 
sign of death he had seen this with his own eyes this sign which his 
mother had once told him of as having been verified in her experience in connection 
with the case of a man who was sick in biloxi he was sick and 
a dog came running along the street and stopped in front of this placea black 
dogand the man died eugene saw this with his own eyesthat is the dog and 
the sick man's death notice the dog howled at four o'clock in the afternoon and 
the next morning the man was dead he saw the crape on the door angela 
mocked at his superstition but he was convinced there are more things in heaven and 
earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy chapter xvi eugene was reaching the 
point where he had no more money and was compelled to think by what process 
he would continue to make a living in the future worry and a hypochondriacal despair 
had reduced his body to a comparatively gaunt condition his eyes had a nervous apprehensive 
look he would walk about speculating upon the mysteries of nature wondering how he was 
to get out of this what was to become of him how soon if ever 
another picture would be sold when angela from having fancied that his illness was a 
mere temporary indisposition had come to feel that he might be seriously affected for some 
time he was not sick physically: he could walk and eat and talk vigorously enough 
but he could not work and he was worrying worrying worrying angela was quite as 
well aware as eugene that their finances were in a bad way or threatening to 
become so though he said nothing at all about them he was ashamed to confess 
at this day after their very conspicuous beginning in new york that he was in 
fear of not doing well how sillyhe with all his ability surely he would get 
over this and soon angela's economical upbringing and naturally saving instinct stood her in good 
stead now for she could market with the greatest care purchase to the best advantage 
make every scrap and penny count she knew how to make her own clothes as 
eugene had found out when he first visited blackwood and was good at designing hats 
although she had thought in new york when eugene first began to make money that 
now she would indulge in tailormade garments and the art of an excellent dressmaker she 
had never done so with true frugality she had decided to wait a little while 
and then eugene's health having failed she had not the chance any more fearing the 
possible long duration of this storm she had begun to mend and clean and press 
and make over whatever seemed to require it even when eugene suggested that she get 
something new she would not do it her consideration for their futurethe difficulty he might 
have in making a living deterred her eugene noted this though he said nothing he 
was not unaware of the fear that she felt the patience she exhibited the sacrifice 
she made of her own whims and desires to his and he was not entirely 
unappreciative it was becoming very apparent to him that she had no life outside his 
ownno interests she was his shadow his alter ego his servant his anything he wanted 
her to be little pigtail was one of his jesting pet names for her because 
in the west as a boy they had always called anyone who ran errands for 
others a pigtailer in playing one old cat if one wanted another to chase the 
struck balls he would say: you pigtail for me willie will you and angela was 
his little pigtail there were no further grounds for jealousy during the time almost two 
years in which they were wandering around together for the reason that she was always 
with him almost his sole companion and that they did not stay long enough in 
any one place and under sufficiently free social conditions to permit him to form those 
intimacies which might have resulted disastrously some girls did take his eyethe exceptional in youth 
and physical perfection were always doing that but he had no chance or very little 
of meeting them socially they were not living with people they knew were not introduced 
in the local social worlds which they visited eugene could only look at these maidens 
whom he chanced to spy from time to time and wish that he might know 
them better it was hard to be tied down to a conventional acceptance of matrimonyto 
pretend that he was interested in beauty only in a sociological way he had to 
do it before angela though and all conventional people for that matter for she objected 
strenuously to the least interest he might manifest in any particular woman all his remarks 
had to be general and guarded in their character at the least show of feeling 
or admiration angela would begin to criticize his choice and to show him wherein his 
admiration was illfounded if he were especially interested she would attempt to tear his latest 
ideal to pieces she had no mercy and he could see plainly enough on what 
her criticism was based it made him smile but he said nothing he even admired 
her for her heroic efforts to hold her own though every victory she seemed to 
win served only to strengthen the bars of his own cage it was during this 
time that he could not help learning and appreciating just how eager patient and genuine 
was her regard for his material welfare to her he was obviously the greatest man 
in the world a great painter a great thinker a great lover a great personality 
every way it didn't make so much difference to her at this time that he 
wasn't making any money he would sometime surely and wasn't she getting it all in 
fame anyhow now why to be mrs eugene witla after what she had seen of 
him in new york and paris what more could she want wasn't it all right 
for her to rake and scrape now to make her own clothes and hats save 
mend press and patch he would come out of all this silly feeling about other 
women once he became a little older and then he would be all right anyhow 
he appeared to love her now and that was something because he was lonely fearsome 
uncertain of himself uncertain of the future he welcomed these unsparing attentions on her part 
and this deceived her who else would give them to him he thought who else 
would be so faithful in times like these he almost came to believe that he 
could love her again be faithful to her if he could keep out of the 
range of these other enticing personalities if only he could stamp out this eager desire 
for other women their praise and their beauty but this was more because he was 
sick and lonely than anything else if he had been restored to health then and 
there if prosperity had descended on him as he so eagerly dreamed it would have 
been the same as ever he was as subtle as nature itself as changeable as 
a chameleon but two things were significant and realtwo things to which he was as 
true and unvarying as the needle to the polehis love of the beauty of life 
which was coupled with his desire to express it in color and his love of 
beauty in the form of the face of a woman or rather that of a 
girl of eighteen that blossoming of life in womanhood at eighteenthere was no other thing 
under the sun like it to him it was like the budding of the trees 
in spring the blossoming of flowers in the early morning the odor of roses and 
dew the color of bright waters and clear jewels he could not be faithless to 
that he could not get away from it it haunted him like a joyous vision 
and the fact that the charms of stella and ruby and angela and christina and 
frieda in whom it had been partially or wholly shadowed forth at one time or 
another had come and gone made little difference it remained clear and demanding he could 
not escape itthe thought he could not deny it he was haunted by this day 
after day and hour after hour and when he said to himself that he was 
a fool and that it would lure him as a willo'thewisp to his destruction and 
that he could find no profit in it ultimately still it would not down the 
beauty of youth the beauty of eighteen to him life without it was a joke 
a shabby scramble a workhorse job with only silly material details like furniture and houses 
and steel cars and stores all involved in a struggle for what to make a 
habitation for more shabby humanity never to make a habitation for beauty certainly what beauty 
the beauty of old agehow silly the beauty of middle age nonsense the beauty of 
maturity no the beauty of youth yes the beauty of eighteen no more and no 
less that was the standard and the history of the world proved it art literature 
romance history poetryif they did not turn on this and the lure of this and 
the wars and sins because of this what did they turn on he was for 
beauty the history of the world justified him who could deny it chapter xvii from 
biloxi because of the approach of summer when it would be unbearably warm there and 
because his funds were so low that it was necessary to make a decisive move 
of some kind whether it led to complete disaster or not he decided to return 
to new york in storage with kellners m charles had kindly volunteered to take care 
of them for him were a number of the pictures left over from the original 
show and nearly all the paintings of the paris exhibition the latter had not sold 
well eugene's idea was that he could slip into new york quietly take a room 
in some side street or in jersey city or brooklyn where he would not be 
seen have the pictures in the possession of m charles returned to him and see 
if he could not get some of the minor art dealers or speculators of whom 
he had heard to come and look at them and buy them outright failing that 
he might take them himself one by one to different dealers here and there and 
dispose of them he remembered now that eberhard zang had through norma whitmore asked him 
to come and see him he fancied that as kellners had been so interested and 
the newspaper critics had spoken of him so kindly the smaller dealers would be eager 
to take up with him surely they would buy this material it was exceptionalvery why 
not eugene forgot or did not know the metaphysical side of prosperity and failure he 
did not realize that as a man thinketh so is he and so also is 
the estimate of the whole world at the time he is thinking of himself thusnot 
as he is but as he thinks he is the sense of it is abroadby 
what processes we know not but so it is eugene's mental state so depressed so 
helpless so fearsomea rudderless boat in the dark transmitted itself as an impression a wireless 
message to all those who knew him or knew of him his breakdown which had 
first astonished m charles depressed and then weakened the latter's interest in him like all 
other capable successful men in the commercial world m charles was for strong menmen in 
the heyday of their success the zenith of their ability the least variation from this 
standard of force and interest was noticeable to him if a man was going to 
failgoing to get sick and lose his interest in life or have his viewpoint affected 
it might be very sad but there was just one thing to do under such 
circumstancesget away from him failures of any kind were dangerous things to countenance one must 
not have anything to do with them they were very unprofitable such people as temple 
boyle and vincent beers who had been his instructors in the past and who had 
heard of him in chicago at the time of his success luke severas william mcconnell 
oren benedict hudson dula and others wondered what had become of him why did he 
not paint any more he was never seen in the new york haunts of art 
it was rumored at the time of the paris exhibition that he was going to 
london to do a similar group of views but the london exhibition never came off 
he had told smite and machugh the spring he left that he might do chicago 
next but that came to nothing there was no evidence of it there were rumors 
that he was very rich that his art had failed him that he had lost 
his mind even and so the art world that knew him and was so interested 
in him no longer cared very much it was too bad butso thought the rival 
artiststhere was one less difficult star to contend with as for his friends they were 
sorry but such was life he might recover if notwell as time went on one 
year another year another year the strangeness of his suddenly brilliant burst and disappearance became 
to the talented in this field a form of classic memory he was a man 
of such promise why did he not go on painting there was an occasional mention 
in conversation or in print but eugene to all intents and purposes was dead when 
he came to new york it was after his capital had been reduced to three 
hundred dollars and he had given angela one hundred and twentyfive of this to take 
her back to blackwood and keep her there until he could make such arrangements as 
would permit her to join him after a long discussion they had finally agreed that 
this would be best for seeing that he could neither paint nor illustrate there was 
no certainty as to what he would do to come here on so little money 
with her was not advisable she had her home where she was welcome to stay 
for a while anyhow meanwhile he figured he could weather any storm alone the appearance 
of the metropolis after somewhat over two years of absence during which he had wandered 
everywhere was most impressive to eugene it was a relief after the mountains of kentucky 
and tennessee and the loneliness of the biloxi coast to get back to this swarming 
city where millions were hurrying to and fro and where one's misery as well as 
one's prosperity was apparently swallowed up in an inconceivable mass of life a subway was 
being built the automobile which only a few years before was having a vague uncertain 
beginning was now attaining a tremendous vogue magnificent cars of new design were everywhere from 
the ferryhouse in jersey city he could see notable changes in the skyline and a 
single walk across twentythird street and up seventh avenue showed him a changing worldgreat hotels 
great apartment houses a tremendous crush of vainglorious life which was moulding the city to 
its desires it depressed him greatly for he had always hoped to be an integral 
part of this magnificence and display and now he was notmight never be again it 
was still raw and cold for the spring was just beginning to break and eugene 
was compelled to buy a light overcoat his own imperishable great coat having been left 
behind and he had no other fit to wear appearances he thought demanded this he 
had spent forty of his closelyguarded one hundred and seventyfive dollars coming from biloxi to 
new york and now an additional fifteen was required for this coat leaving him one 
hundred and twentyfive dollars with which to begin his career anew he was greatly worried 
as to the outcome but curiously also he had an abiding subconscious feeling that it 
could not be utterly destructive to him he rented a cheap room in a semirespectable 
neighborhood in west twentyfourth street near eleventh avenue solely because he wanted to keep out 
of the run of intellectual life and hide until he could get on his feet 
it was an old and shabby residence in an old and shabby red brick neighborhood 
such as he had drawn in one of his views but it was not utterly 
bad the people were poor but fairly intellectual he chose this particular neighborhood with all 
its poverty because it was near the north river where the great river traffic could 
be seen and where because of some open lots in which were stored wagons his 
one single west window gave him a view of all this life about the corner 
in twentythird street in another somewhat decayed residence was a moderate priced restaurant and boarding 
house here he could get a meal for twentyfive cents he cared nothing for the 
life that was about him it was cheap poor from a money point of view 
dingy but he would not be here forever he hoped these people did not know 
him besides the number west th street did not sound bad it might be one 
of the old neighborhoods with which new york was dotted and which artists were inclined 
to find and occupy after he had secured this room from a semirespectable irish landlady 
a dock weigher's wife he decided to call upon m charles he knew that he 
looked quite respectable as yet despite his poverty and decline his clothes were good his 
overcoat new his manner brisk and determined but what he could not see was that 
his face in its thin sallowness and his eyes with their semifeverish lustre bespoke a 
mind that was harassed by trouble of some kind he stood outside the office of 
kellner and son in fifth avenuea half block from the door wondering whether he should 
go in and just what he should say he had written to m charles from 
time to time that his health was bad and that he couldn't workalways that he 
hoped to be better soon he had always hoped that a reply would come that 
another of his pictures had been sold one year had gone and then two and 
now a third was under way and still he was not any better m charles 
would look at him searchingly he would have to bear his gaze unflinchingly in his 
present nervous state this was difficult and yet he was not without a kind of 
defiance even now he would force himself back into favor with life sometime he finally 
mustered up his courage and entered and m charles greeted him warmly this certainly is 
goodto see you again i had almost given up hope that you would ever come 
back to new york how is your health now and how is mrs witla it 
doesn't seem as though it had been three years you're looking excellent and how is 
painting going now getting to the point where you can do something again eugene felt 
for the moment as though m charles believed him to be in excellent condition whereas 
that shrewd observer of men was wondering what could have worked so great a change 
eugene appeared to be eight years older there were marked wrinkles between his eyes and 
an air of lassitude and weariness he thought to himself why this man may possibly 
be done for artistically something has gone from him which i noted the first time 
i met him: that fire and intense enthusiasm which radiated force after the fashion of 
an arclight now he seems to be seeking to draw something into save himself from 
drowning as it were he is making a voiceless appeal for consideration what a pity 
the worst of it all was that in his estimation nothing could be done in 
such a case you couldn't do anything for an artist who could do nothing for 
himself his art was gone the sanest thing for him to do would be to 
quit trying go at some other form of labor and forget all about it it 
might be that he would recover but it was a question nervous breakdowns were not 
infrequently permanent eugene noticed something of this in his manner he couldn't tell exactly what 
it was but m charles seemed more than ordinarily preoccupied careful and distant he wasn't 
exactly chilly in his manner but reserved as though he were afraid he might be 
asked to do something which he could not very well do i noticed that the 
paris scenes did not do very well either here or in paris observed eugene with 
an air of nonchalance as though it were a matter of small importance at the 
same time hoping that he would have some favorable word i had the idea that 
they would take better than they did still i don't suppose i ought to expect 
everything to sell the new york ones did all right they did very well indeed 
much better than i expected i didn't think as many would be sold as were 
they were very new and considerably outside the lines of current interest the paris pictures 
on the other hand were foreign to americans in the wrong sense by that i 
mean they weren't to be included in that genre art which comes from abroad but 
is not based on any locality and is universal in its appealthematically speaking your paris 
pictures were of course pictures in the best sense to those who see art as 
color and composition and idea but to the ordinary lay mind they were i take 
it merely paris scenes you get what i mean in that sense they were foreign 
and paris has been done illustratively anyhow you might have done better with london or 
chicago still you have every reason to congratulate yourself your work made a distinct impression 
both here and in france when you feel able to return to it i have 
no doubt you will find that time has done you no harm he tried to 
be polite and entertaining but he was glad when eugene went away again the latter 
turned out into the street disconsolate he could see how things were he was down 
and out for the present and would have to wait chapter xviii the next thing 
was to see what could be done with the other art dealers and the paintings 
that were left there were quite a number of them if he could get any 
reasonable price at all he ought to be able to live quite awhilelong enough anyhow 
to get on his feet again when they came to his quiet room and were 
unpacked by him in a rather shamefaced and disturbed manner and distributed about they seemed 
wonderful things why if the critics had raved over them and m charles had thought 
they were so fine could they not be sold art dealers would surely buy them 
still now that he was on the ground again and could see the distinctive art 
shops from the sidewalks his courage failed him they were not running after pictures exceptional 
as he might be there were artists in plentygood ones he could not run to 
other well known art dealers very well for his work had become identified with the 
house of kellner and son some of the small dealers might buy them but they 
would not buy them allprobably one or two at the most and that at a 
sacrifice what a pass to come tohe eugene witla who three years before had been 
in the heyday of his approaching prosperity wondering as he stood in the room of 
a gloomy sidestreet house how he was going to raise money to live through the 
summer and how he was going to sell the paintings which had seemed the substance 
of his fortune but two years before he decided that he would ask several of 
the middle class dealers whether they would not come and look at what he had 
to show to a number of the smaller dealers in fourth sixth eighth avenues and 
elsewhere he would offer to sell several outright when necessity pinched still he had to 
raise money soon angela could not be left at blackwood indefinitely he went to jacob 
bergman henry larue pottle frères and asked if they would be interested to see what 
he had henry bergman who was his own manager recalled his name at once he 
had seen the exhibition but was not eager he asked curiously how the pictures of 
the first and second exhibitions had sold how many there were of them what prices 
they brought eugene told him you might bring one or two here and leave them 
on sale you know how that is someone might take a fancy to them you 
never can tell he explained that his commission was twentyfive per cent and that he 
would report when a sale was made he was not interested to come and see 
them eugene could select any two pictures he pleased it was the same with henry 
larue and pottle frères though the latter had never heard of him they asked him 
to show them one of his pictures eugene's pride was touched the least bit by 
this lack of knowledge on their part though seeing how things were going with him 
he felt as though he might expect as much and more other art dealers he 
did not care to trust with his paintings on sale and he was now ashamed 
to start carrying them about to the magazines where at least one hundred and twentyfive 
to one hundred and fifty per picture might be expected for them if they were 
sold at all he did not want the magazine art world to think that he 
had come to this his best friend was hudson dula and he might no longer 
be art director of truth as a matter of fact dula was no longer there 
then there were jan jansen and several others but they were no doubt thinking of 
him now as a successful painter it seemed as though his natural pride were building 
insurmountable barriers for him how was he to live if he could not do this 
and could not paint he decided on trying the small art dealers with a single 
picture offering to sell it outright they might not recognize him and so might buy 
it direct he could accept in such cases without much shock to his pride anything 
which they might offer if it were not too little he tried this one bright 
morning in may and though it was not without result it spoiled the beautiful day 
for him he took one picture a new york scene and carried it to a 
third rate art dealer whose place he had seen in upper sixth avenue and without 
saying anything about himself asked if he would like to buy it the proprietor a 
small dark individual of semitic extraction looked at him curiously and at his picture he 
could tell from a single look that eugene was in trouble that he needed money 
and that he was anxious to sell his picture he thought of course that he 
would take anything for it and he was not sure that he wanted the picture 
at that it was not very popular in theme a view of a famous sixth 
avenue restaurant showing behind the track of the l road with a driving rain pouring 
in between the interstices of light years after this picture was picked up by a 
collector from kansas city at an old furniture sale and hung among his gems but 
this morning its merits were not very much in evidence i see that you occasionally 
exhibit a painting in your window for sale do you buy originals now and again 
said the man indifferentlynot often what have you i have an oil here that i 
painted not so long ago i occasionally do these things i thought maybe you would 
like to buy it the proprietor stood by indifferently while eugene untied the string took 
off the paper and stood the picture up for inspection it was striking enough in 
its way but it did not appeal to him as being popular i don't think 
it's anything that i could sell here he remarked shrugging his shoulders it's good but 
we don't have much call for pictures of any kind if it were a straight 
landscape or a marine or a figure of some kind figures sell best but thisi 
doubt if i could get rid of it you might leave it on sale if 
you want to somebody might like it i don't think i'd care to buy it 
i don't care to leave it on sale replied eugene irritably leave one of his 
pictures in a cheap sidestreet art storeand that on sale he would not he wanted 
to say something cutting in reply but he curbed his welling wrath to ask how 
much do you think it would be worth if you did want it oh replied 
the proprietor pursing his lips reflectively not more than ten dollars we can't ask much 
for anything we have on view here the fifth avenue stores take all the good 
trade eugene winced ten dollars why what a ridiculous sum what was the use of 
coming to a place like this anyhow he could do better dealing with the art 
directors or the better stores but where were they whom could he deal with where 
were there any stores much better than this outside the large ones which he had 
already canvassed he had better keep his pictures and go to work now at something 
else he only had thirtyfive of them all told and at this rate he would 
have just three hundred and fifty dollars when they were all gone what good would 
that do him his mood and this preliminary experience convinced him that they could not 
be sold for any much greater sum fifteen dollars or less would probably be offered 
and he would be no better off at the end his pictures would be gone 
and he would have nothing he ought to get something to do and save his 
pictures but what to a man in eugene's positionhe was now thirtyone years of age 
with no training outside what he had acquired in developing his artistic judgment and abilitythis 
proposition of finding something else which he could do was very difficult his mental sickness 
was of course the first great bar it made him appear nervous and discouraged and 
so more or less objectionable to anyone who was looking for vigorous healthy manhood in 
the shape of an employee in the next place his look and manner had become 
decidedly that of the artistrefined retiring subtle he also had an air at times of 
finicky standoffishness particularly in the presence of those who appeared to him commonplace or who 
by their look or manner appeared to be attempting to set themselves over him in 
the last place he could think of nothing that he really wanted to dothe idea 
that his art ability would come back to him or that it ought to serve 
him in this crisis haunting him all the time once he had thought he might 
like to be an art director he was convinced that he would be a good 
one and another time he had thought he would like to write but that was 
long ago he had never written anything since the chicago newspaper specials and several efforts 
at concentrating his mind for this quickly proved to him that writing was not for 
him now it was hard for him to formulate an intelligent consecutiveidea'd letter to angela 
he harked back to his old chicago days and remembering that he had been a 
collector and a driver of a laundry wagon he decided that he might do something 
of that sort getting a position as a streetcar conductor or a drygoods clerk appealed 
to him as possibilities the necessity of doing something within regular hours and in a 
routine way appealed to him as having curative properties how should he get such a 
thing if it had not been for the bedeviled state of his mind this would 
not have been such a difficult matter for he was physically active enough to hold 
any ordinary position he might have appealed frankly and simply to m charles or isaac 
wertheim and through influence obtained something which would have tided him over but he was 
too sensitive to begin with and his present weakness made him all the more fearful 
and retiring he had but one desire when he thought of doing anything outside his 
creative gift and that was to slink away from the gaze of men how could 
he with his appearance his reputation his tastes and refinement hobnob with conductors drygoods clerks 
railroad hands or drivers it wasn't possiblehe hadn't the strength besides all that was a 
thing of the past or he thought it was he had put it behind him 
in his art student days now to have to get out and look for a 
job how could he he walked the streets for days and days coming back to 
his room to see if by any chance he could paint yet writing long rambling 
emotional letters to angela it was pitiful in fits of gloom he would take out 
an occasional picture and sell it parting with it for ten or fifteen dollars after 
he had carried it sometimes for miles his one refuge was in walking for somehow 
he could not walk and feel very very bad the beauty of nature the activity 
of people entertained and diverted his mind he would come back to his room some 
evenings feeling as though a great change had come over him as though he were 
going to do better now but this did not last long a little while and 
he would be back in his old mood again he spent three months this way 
drifting before he realized that he must do somethingthat fall and winter would be coming 
on again in a little while and he would have nothing at all in his 
desperation he first attempted to get an art directorship but two or three interviews with 
publishers of magazines proved to him pretty quickly that positions of this character were not 
handed out to the inexperienced it required an apprenticeship just as anything else did and 
those who had positions in this field elsewhere had the first call his name or 
appearance did not appear to strike any of these gentlemen as either familiar or important 
in any way they had heard of him as an illustrator and a painter but 
his present appearance indicated that this was a refuge in ill health which he was 
seeking not a vigorous constructive position and so they would have none of him he 
next tried at three of the principal publishing houses but they did not require anyone 
in that capacity truth to tell he knew very little of the details and responsibilities 
of the position though he thought he did after that there was nothing save drygoods 
stores streetcar registration offices the employment offices of the great railroads and factories he looked 
at sugar refineries tobacco factories express offices railroad freight offices wondering whether in any of 
these it would be possible for him to obtain a position which would give him 
a salary of ten dollars a week if he could get that and any of 
the pictures now on show with jacob bergman henry larue and pottle frères should be 
sold he could get along he might even live on this with angela if he 
could sell an occasional picture for ten or fifteen dollars but he was paying seven 
dollars a week for nothing save food and room and scarcely managing to cling to 
the one hundred dollars which had remained of his original traveling fund after he had 
paid all his opening expenses here in new york he was afraid to part with 
all his pictures in this way for fear he would be sorry for it after 
a while work is hard to get under the most favorable conditions of health and 
youth and ambition and the difficulties of obtaining it under unfavorable ones need not be 
insisted on imagine if you can the crowds of men forty fifty one hundred strong 
that wait at the door of every drygoods employment office every streetcar registration bureau on 
the special days set aside for considering applications at every factory shop or office where 
an advertisement calling for a certain type of man or woman was inserted in the 
newspapers on a few occasions that eugene tried or attempted to try he found himself 
preceded by peculiar groups of individuals who eyed him curiously as he approached wondering as 
he thought whether a man of his type could be coming to apply for a 
job they seemed radically different from himself to his mind men with little education and 
a grim consciousness of the difficulties of life young men vapid looking men shabby stale 
discouraged typesmen who like himself looked as though they had seen something very much better 
and men who looked as though they had seen things a great deal worse the 
evidence which frightened him was the presence of a group of bright healthy eager looking 
boys of nineteen twenty twentyone and twentytwo who like himself when he first went to 
chicago years before were everywhere he went when he drew near he invariably found it 
impossible to indicate in any way that he was looking for anything he couldn't his 
courage failed him he felt that he looked too superior selfconsciousness and shame overcame him 
he learned now that men rose as early as four o'clock in the morning to 
buy a newspaper and ran quickly to the address mentioned in order to get the 
place at the head of the line thus getting the first consideration as an applicant 
he learned that some other men such as waiters cooks hotel employees and so on 
frequently stayed up all night in order to buy a paper at two in the 
morning winter or summer rain or snow heat or cold and hurry to the promising 
addresses they might find he learned that the crowds of applicants were apt to become 
surly or sarcastic or contentious as their individual chances were jeopardized by everincreasing numbers and 
all this was going on all the time in winter or summer heat or cold 
rain or snow pretending interest as a spectator he would sometimes stand and watch hearing 
the ribald jests the slurs cast upon life fortune individuals in particular and in general 
by those who were wearily or hopelessly waiting it was a horrible picture to him 
in his present condition it was like the grinding of the millstones upper and nether 
these were the chaff he was a part of the chaff at present or in 
danger of becoming so life was winnowing him out he might go down down and 
there might never be an opportunity for him to rise any more few if any 
of us understand thoroughly the nature of the unconscious stratification which takes place in life 
the layers and types and classes into which it assorts itself and the barriers which 
these offer to a free migration of individuals from one class to another we take 
on so naturally the material habiliments of our temperaments necessities and opportunities priests doctors lawyers 
merchants appear to be born with their particular mental attitude and likewise the clerk the 
ditchdigger the janitor they have their codes their guilds and their class feelings and while 
they may be spiritually closely related they are physically far apart eugene after hunting for 
a place for a month knew a great deal more about this stratification than he 
had ever dreamed of knowing he found that he was naturally barred by temperament from 
some things from others by strength and weight or rather the lack of them from 
others by inexperience from others by age and so on and those who were different 
from him in any or all of these respects were inclined to look at him 
askance you are not as we are their eyes seemed to say why do you 
come here one day he approached a gang of men who were waiting outside a 
car barn and sought to find out where the registration office was he did not 
lay off his natural manner of superioritycould not but asked a man near him if 
he knew it had taken all his courage to do this he wouldn't be after 
lookin' fer a place as a conductor now would he he heard someone say within 
his hearing for some reason this remark took all his courage away he went up 
the wooden stairs to the little office where the application blanks were handed out but 
did not even have the courage to apply for one he pretended to be looking 
for someone and went out again later before a drygoods superintendent's office he heard a 
youth remark look what wants to be a clerk it froze him it is a 
question how long this aimless nervous wandering would have continued if it had not been 
for the accidental recollection of an experience which a fellow artist once related to him 
of a writer who had found himself nervously depressed and who by application to the 
president of a railroad had secured as a courtesy to the profession which he represented 
so ably a position as an apprentice in a surveying corps being given transportation to 
a distant section of the country and employed at a laborer's wages until he was 
well eugene now thought of this as quite an idea for himself why it had 
not occurred to him before he did not know he could apply as an artisthis 
appearance would bear him out and being able to speak from the vantage point of 
personal ability temporarily embarrassed by ill health his chances of getting something would be so 
much better it would not be the same as a position which he had secured 
for himself without fear or favor but it would be a position different from farming 
with angela's father because it would command a salary chapter xix this idea of appealing 
to the president of one of the great railroads that entered new york was not 
so difficult to execute eugene dressed himself very carefully the next morning and going to 
the office of the company in fortysecond street consulted the list of officers posted in 
one of the halls and finding the president to be on the third floor ascended 
he discovered after compelling himself by sheer will power to enter that this socalled office 
was a mere anteroom to a force of assistants serving the president and that no 
one could see him except by appointment you might see his secretary if he isn't 
busy suggested the clerk who handled his card gingerly eugene was for the moment undetermined 
what to do but decided that maybe the secretary could help him he asked that 
his card might be taken to him and that no explanation be demanded of him 
except by the secretary in person the latter came out after a while an under 
secretary of perhaps twentyeight years of age short and stout he was bland and apparently 
good natured what is it i can do for you he asked eugene had been 
formulating his request in his mindsome method of putting it briefly and simply i came 
up to see mr wilson he said to see if he would not send me 
out as a daylaborer of some kind in connection with some department of the road 
i am an artist by profession and i am suffering from neurasthenia all the doctors 
i have consulted have recommended that i get a simple manual position of some kind 
and work at it until i am well i know of an instance in which 
mr wilson assisted in this way mr savin the author and i thought he might 
be willing to interest himself in my case at the sound of henry savin's name 
the undersecretary pricked up his ears he had fortunately read one of his books and 
this together with eugene's knowledge of the case his personal appearance a certain ring of 
sincerity in what he was saying caused him to be momentarily interested there is no 
position in connection with any clerical work which the president could give you i am 
sure he replied all of these things are subject to a system of promotion it 
might be that he could place you with one of the construction gangs in one 
of the departments under a foreman i don't know it's very hard work though he 
might consider your case he smiled commiseratingly i question whether you're strong enough to do 
anything of that sort it takes a pretty good man to wield a pick or 
a shovel i don't think i had better worry about that now replied eugene in 
return smiling wearily i'll take the work and see if it won't help me i 
think i need it badly enough he was afraid the undersecretary would repent of his 
suggestion and refuse him entirely can you wait a little while asked the latter curiously 
he had the idea that eugene was someone of importance for he had suggested as 
a parting argument that he could give a number of exceptional references certainly said eugene 
and the secretary went his way coming back in half an hour to hand him 
an enveloped letter we have the idea he said quite frankly waiving any suggestion of 
the president's influence in the matter and speaking for himself and the secretaryinchief with whom 
he had agreed that eugene ought to be assisted that you had best apply to 
the engineering department mr hobsen the chiefengineer can arrange for you this letter i think 
will get you what you want eugene's heart bounded he looked at the superscription and 
saw it addressed to mr woodruff hobsen chief engineer and putting it in his pocket 
without stopping to read it but thanking the undersecretary profusely went out in the hall 
at a safe distance he stopped and opened it finding that it spoke of him 
familiarly as mr eugene witla an artist temporarily incapacitated by neurasthenia and went on to 
say that he was desirous of being appointed to some manual toil in some construction 
corps the president's office recommends this request to your favor when he read this he 
knew it meant a position it roused curious feelings as to the nature and value 
of stratification as a laborer he was nothing: as an artist he could get a 
position as a laborer after all his ability as an artist was worth something it 
obtained him this refuge he hugged it joyously and a few moments later handed it 
to an undersecretary in the chiefengineer's office without being seen by anyone in authority he 
was in return given a letter to mr william haverford engineer of maintenance of way 
a pale anæmic gentleman of perhaps forty years of age who as eugene learned from 
him when he was eventually ushered into his presence a half hour later was a 
captain of thirteen thousand men the latter read the letter from the engineer's office curiously 
he was struck by eugene's odd mission and his appearance as a man artists were 
queer this was like one eugene reminded him of himself a little in his appearance 
an artist he said interestedly so you want to work as a day laborer he 
fixed eugene with clear coalblack eyes looking out of a long pearshaped face eugene noticed 
that his hands were long and thin and white and that his high pale forehead 
was crowned by a mop of black hair neurasthenia i've heard a great deal about 
that of late but have never been troubled that way myself i find that i 
derive considerable benefit when i am nervous from the use of a rubber exerciser you 
have seen them perhaps yes eugene replied i have my case is much too grave 
for that i think i have traveled a great deal but it doesn't seem to 
do me any good i want work at something manual i fancysomething at which i 
have to work exercise in a room would not help me i think i need 
a complete change of environment i will be much obliged if you will place me 
in some capacity well this will very likely be it suggested mr haverford blandly working 
as a daylaborer will certainly not strike you as play to tell you the truth 
i don't think you can stand it he reached for a glassframed map showing the 
various divisions of the railroad stretching from new england to chicago and st louis and 
observed quietly i could send you to a great many places pennsylvania new york ohio 
michigan canada his finger roved idly about i have thirteen thousand men in my department 
and they are scattered far and wide eugene marveled such a position such authority this 
pale dark man sitting as an engineer at a switch board directing so large a 
machine you have a large force he said simply mr haverford smiled wanly i think 
if you will take my advice you will not go in a construction corps right 
away you can hardly do manual labor there is a little carpenter shop which we 
have at speonk not very far outside the city which i should think would answer 
your needs admirably a little creek joins the hudson there and it's out on a 
point of land the shop is it's summer now and to put you in a 
broiling sun with a gang of italians would be a little rough take my advice 
and go here it will be hard enough after you are broken in and you 
think you want a change i can easily arrange it for you the money may 
not make so much difference to you but you may as well have it it 
will be fifteen cents an hour i will give you a letter to mr litlebrown 
our division engineer and he will see that you are properly provided for eugene bowed 
inwardly he smiled at the thought that the money would not be acceptable to him 
anything would be acceptable perhaps this would be best it was near the city the 
description of the little carpenter shop out on the neck of land appealed to him 
it was as he found when he looked at the map of the immediate division 
to which this belonged almost within the city limits he could live in new yorkthe 
upper portion of it anyhow again there was a letter this time to mr henry 
c litlebrown a tall meditative philosophic man whom eugene found two days later in the 
division offices at yonkers who in turn wrote a letter to mr joseph brooks superintendent 
of buildings at mott haven whose secretary finally gave eugene a letter to mr jack 
stix foreman carpenter at speonk this letter when presented on a bright friday afternoon brought 
him the advice to come monday at seven a m and so eugene saw a 
career as a day laborer stretching very conspicuously before him the little shop in question 
was located in the most charming manner possible if it had been set as a 
stage scene for his especial artistic benefit it could not have been better on a 
point of land between the river and the main line of the railroad and a 
little creek which was east of the railroad and which the latter crossed on a 
trestle to get back to the mainland again it stood a long low twostorey structure 
green as to its roof red as to its body full of windows which commanded 
picturesque views of passing yachts and steamers and little launches and rowboats anchored safely in 
the waters of the cove which the creek formed there was a veritable song of 
labor which arose from this shop for it was filled with planes lathes and woodturning 
instruments of various kinds to say nothing of a great group of carpenters who could 
make desks chairs tables in short office furniture of various kinds and who kept the 
company's needs of these fittings for its depots and offices well supplied each carpenter had 
a bench before a window on the second floor and in the centre were the 
few necessary machines they were always using small jig cross cut band and rip saws 
a plane and four or five lathes on the ground floor was the engine room 
the blacksmith's shop the giant plane the great jig and cross cut saws and the 
store room and supply closets out in the yard were piles of lumber with tracks 
in between and twice every day a local freight called the dinky stopped to switch 
in or take out loaded cars of lumber or finished furniture and supplies eugene as 
he approached on the day he presented his letter stopped to admire the neatness of 
the low board fence which surrounded it all the beauty of the water the droning 
sweetness of the saws why the work here couldn't be very hard he thought he 
saw carpenters looking out of the upper windows and a couple of men in brown 
overalls and jumpers unloading a car they were carrying great threebysix joists on their shoulders 
would he be asked to do anything like that he scarcely thought so mr haverford 
had distinctly indicated in his letter to mr litlebrown that he was to be built 
up by degrees carrying great joists did not appeal to him as the right way 
but he presented his letter he had previously looked about on the high ground which 
lay to the back of the river and which commanded this point of land to 
see if he could find a place to board and lodge but had seen nothing 
the section was very exclusive occupied by suburban new yorkers of wealth and they were 
not interested in the proposition which he had formulated in his own mind namely his 
temporary reception somewhere as a paying guest he had visions of a comfortable home somewhere 
now with nice people for strangely enough the securing of this very minor position had 
impressed him as the beginning of the end of his bad luck he was probably 
going to get well now in the course of time if he could only live 
with some nice family for the summer in the fall if he were improving and 
he thought he might be angela could come on it might be that one of 
the dealers pottle frères or jacob bergman or henry larue would have sold a picture 
one hundred and fifty or two hundred dollars joined to his salary would go a 
long way towards making their living moderately comfortable besides angela's taste and economy coupled with 
his own art judgment could make any little place look respectable and attractive the problem 
of finding a room was not so easy he followed the track south to a 
settlement which was visible from the shop windows a quarter of a mile away and 
finding nothing which suited his taste as to location returned to speonk proper and followed 
the little creek inland half a mile this adventure delighted him for it revealed a 
semicircle of charming cottages ranged upon a hill slope which had for its footstool the 
little silverybosomed stream between the stream and the hill slope ran a semicircular road and 
above that another road eugene could see at a glance that here was middle class 
prosperity smooth lawns bright awnings flower pots of blue and yellow and green upon the 
porches doorsteps and verandas an auto standing in front of one house indicated a certain 
familiarity with the ways of the rich and a summer road house situated at the 
intersection of a road leading out from new york and the little stream where it 
was crossed by a bridge indicated that the charms of this village were not unknown 
to those who came touring and seeking for pleasure the road house itself was hung 
with awnings and one dining balcony out over the water eugene's desire was fixed on 
this village at once he wanted to live hereanywhere in it he walked about under 
the cool shade of the trees looking at first one door yard and then another 
wishing that he might introduce himself by letter and be received they ought to welcome 
an artist of his ability and refinement and would he thought if they knew his 
working in a furniture factory or for the railroad as a day laborer for his 
health simply added to his picturesque character in his wanderings he finally came upon a 
methodist church quaintly built of red brick and grey stone trimmings and the sight of 
its tall stained glass windows and square fortresslike belltower gave him an idea why not 
appeal to the minister he could explain to him what he wanted show him his 
credentialsfor he had with him old letters from editors publishers and art housesand give him 
a clear understanding as to why he wanted to come here at all his ill 
health and distinction ought to appeal to this man and he would probably direct him 
to some one who would gladly have him at five in the afternoon he knocked 
at the door and was received in the pastor's studya large still room in which 
a few flies were buzzing in the shaded light in a few moments the minister 
himself came ina tall greyheaded man severely simple in his attire and with the easy 
air of one who is used to public address he was about to ask what 
he could do for him when eugene began with his explanation you don't know me 
at all i am a stranger in this section i am an artist by profession 
and i am coming to speonk on monday to work in the railroad shop there 
for my health i have been suffering from a nervous breakdown and am going to 
try day labor for awhile i want to find a convenient pleasant place to live 
and i thought you might know of someone here or near here who might be 
willing to take me in for a little while i can give excellent references there 
doesn't appear to be anything in the immediate neighborhood of the shop it is rather 
isolated there replied the old minister studying eugene carefully i have often wondered how all 
those men like it traveling so far none of them live about here he looked 
at eugene solemnly taking in his various characteristics he was not badly impressed he seemed 
to be a reserved thoughtful dignified young man and decidedly artistic it struck him as 
very interesting that he should be trying so radical a thing as day labor for 
his nerves let me see he said thoughtfully he sat down in his chair near 
his table and put his hand over his eyes i don't think of anyone just 
at the moment there are plenty of families who have room to take you if 
they would but i question very much whether they would in fact i'm rather sure 
they wouldn't let me see now he thought again eugene studied his big aquiline nose 
his shaggy grey eyebrows his thick crisp grey hair already his mind was sketching him 
the desk the dim walls the whole atmosphere of the room no no he said 
slowly i don't think of anyone there is one familymrs hibberdell she lives in thelet 
me seefirst second third tenth house above here she has one nephew with her at 
present a young man of about your age and i don't think anyone else i 
don't know that she would consider taking you in but she might her house is 
quite large she did have her daughter with her at one time but i'm not 
sure that she's there now i think not he talked as though he were reporting 
his own thoughts to himself audibly eugene pricked up his ears at the mention of 
a daughter during all the time he had been out of new york he had 
not with the exception of frieda had a single opportunity to talk intimately with any 
girl angela had been with him all the time here in new york since he 
had been back he had been living under such distressing conditions that he had not 
thought of either youth or love he had no business to be thinking of it 
now but this summer air this treeshaded village the fact that he had a position 
small as it was on which he could depend and which would no doubt benefit 
him mentally and that he was somehow feeling better about himself because he was going 
to work made him feel that he might look more interestedly on life again he 
was not going to die he was going to get well finding this position proved 
it and he might go to the house now and find some charming girl who 
would like him very much angela was away he was alone he had again the 
freedom of his youth if he were only well and working he thanked the old 
minister very politely and went his way recognizing the house by certain details given him 
by the minister a double balconied veranda some red rockers two yellow jardinières at the 
doorstep a greyish white picket fence and gate he walked up smartly and rang the 
bell a very intelligent woman of perhaps fiftyfive or sixty with bright grey hair and 
clear light blue eyes was coming out with a book in her hand eugene stated 
his case she listened with keen interest looking him over the while his appearance took 
her fancy for she was of a strong intellectual and literary turn of mind i 
wouldn't ordinarily consider anything of the kind but i am alone here with my nephew 
and the house could easily accommodate a dozen i don't want to do anything which 
will irritate him but if you will come back in the morning i will let 
you know it would not disturb me to have you about do you happen to 
know of an artist by the name of deesa i know him well replied eugene 
he's an old friend of mine he is a friend of my daughter's i think 
have you enquired anywhere else here in the village no said eugene that is just 
as well she replied he took the hint so there was no daughter here well 
what matter the view was beautiful of an evening he could sit out here in 
one of the rocking chairs and look at the water the evening sun already low 
in the west was burnishing it a bright gold the outline of the hill on 
the other side was dignified and peaceful he could sleep and work as a day 
laborer and take life easy for a while he could get well now and this 
was the way to do it day laborer how fine how original how interesting he 
felt somewhat like a knighterrant reconnoitring a new and very strange world chapter xx the 
matter of securing admission to this house was quickly settled the nephew a genial intelligent 
man of thirtyfour as eugene discovered later had no objection it appeared to eugene that 
in some way he contributed to the support of this house though mrs hibberdell obviously 
had some money of her own a charmingly furnished room on the second floor adjoining 
one of the several baths was assigned him and he was at once admitted to 
the freedom of the house there were books a piano but no one to play 
it a hammock a maidofallwork and an atmosphere of content and peace mrs hibberdell a 
widow presumably of some years of widowhood was of that experience and judgment in life 
which gave her intellectual poise she was not particularly inquisitive about anything in connection with 
him and so far as he could see from surface indications was refined silent conservative 
she could jest and did in a subtle understanding way he told her quite frankly 
at the time he applied that he was married that his wife was in the 
west and that he expected her to return after his health was somewhat improved she 
talked with him about art and books and life in general music appeared to be 
to her a thing apart she did not care much for it the nephew davis 
simpson was neither literary nor artistic and apparently cared little for music he was a 
buyer for one of the larger department stores a slight dapper rather dandified type of 
man with a lean not thin but tightmuscled face and a short black mustache and 
he appeared to be interested only in the humors of character trade baseball and methods 
of entertaining himself the things that pleased eugene about him were that he was clean 
simple direct goodnatured and courteous he had apparently no desire to infringe on anybody's privacy 
but was fond of stirring up light discussions and interpolating witty remarks he liked also 
to grow flowers and to fish the care of a border of flowers which glorified 
a short gravel path in the back yard received his especial attention evenings and mornings 
it was a great pleasure for eugene to come into this atmosphere after the storm 
which had been assailing him for the past three years and particularly for the past 
ninety days he was only asked to pay eight dollars a week by mrs hibberdell 
though he realized that what he was obtaining in home atmosphere here was not ordinarily 
purchasable at any price in the public market the maid saw to it that a 
little bouquet of flowers was put on his dressing table daily he was given fresh 
towels and linen in ample quantities the bath was his own he could sit out 
on the porch of an evening and look at the water uninterrupted or he could 
stay in the library and read breakfast and dinner were invariably delightful occasions for though 
he rose at fivefortyfive in order to have his bath breakfast and be able to 
walk to the factory and reach it by seven mrs hibberdell was invariably up as 
it was her habit to rise thus early had been so for years she liked 
it eugene in his weary mood could scarcely understand this davis came to the table 
some few moments before he would be leaving he invariably had some cheery remark to 
offer for he was never sullen or gloomy his affairs whatever they were did not 
appear to oppress him mrs hibberdell would talk to eugene genially about his work this 
small social centre of which they were a part and which was called riverwood the 
current movements in politics religion science and so forth there were references sometimes to her 
one daughter who was married and living in new york it appeared that she occasionally 
visited her mother here eugene was delighted to think he had been so fortunate as 
to find this place he hoped to make himself so agreeable that there would be 
no question as to his welcome and he was not disappointed between themselves mrs hibberdell 
and davis discussed him agreeing that he was entirely charming a good fellow and well 
worth having about at the factory where eugene worked and where the conditions were radically 
different he made for himself an atmosphere which was almost entirely agreeable to him though 
he quarreled at times with specific details on the first morning for instance he was 
put to work with two men heavy clods of souls he thought at first familiarly 
known about the yard as john and bill these two to his artistic eye appeared 
machines more mechanical than humanly selfdirective they were of medium height not more than five 
feet nine inches tall and weighed about one hundred and eighty pounds each one had 
a round poorly modeled face very much the shape of an egg to which was 
attached a heavy yellowish mustache he had a glass eye complicated in addition by a 
pair of spectacles which were fastened over his large protruding red ears with steel hooks 
he wore a battered brown hat now a limp shapeless mass his name was bill 
jeffords and he responded sometimes to the sobriquet of one eye the other man was 
john alias jack duncan an individual of the same height and build with but slightly 
more modeling to his face and with little if any greater intelligence he looked somewhat 
the shrewdereugene fancied there might be lurking in him somewhere a spark of humor but 
he was mistaken unquestionably in jeffords there was none jack stix the foremancarpenter a tall 
angular ambling man with red hair a red mustache shifty uncertain blue eyes and noticeably 
big hands and feet had suggested to eugene that he work with these men for 
a little while it was his idea to try him out as he told one 
of the associate foremen who was in charge of a gang of italians working in 
the yard for the morning and he was quite equal to doing it he thought 
eugene had no business here and might possibly be scared off by a little rough 
work he's up here for his health he told him i don't know where he 
comes from mr brooks sent him up here with orders to put him on i 
want to see how he takes to real work for awhile look out you don't 
hurt him suggested the other he don't look very strong to me he's strong enough 
to carry a few spiles i guess if jimmy can carry 'em he can i 
don't intend to keep him at it long eugene knew nothing of this but when 
he was told to come along new man and shown a pile of round rough 
ash trunk cutting six inches in diameter and eight feet long his courage failed him 
he was suffered to carry some of these to the second floor how many he 
did not know take 'em to thompson up there in the corner said jeffords dully 
eugene grasped one uncertainly in the middle with his thin artistic hands he did not 
know that there were ways of handling lumber just as there were ways of handling 
a brush he tried to lift it but could not the rough bark scratched his 
fingers cruelly yah gotta learn somepin about that before yuh begin i guess said jack 
duncan who had been standing by eyeing him narrowly jeffords had gone about some other 
work i suppose i don't know very much about it replied eugene shamefacedly stopping and 
waiting for further instructions lemme show you a trick said his associate there's tricks in 
all these here trades take it by the end thisaway and push it along until 
you can stand it up stoop down now and put your shoulder right next the 
middle gotta pad under your shirt you oughtta have one now put your right arm 
out ahead o'yuh on the spile now you're all right eugene straightened up and the 
rough post balanced itself evenly but crushingly on his shoulder it appeared to grind his 
muscles and his back and legs ached instantly he started bravely forward straining to appear 
at ease but within fifty feet he was suffering agony he walked the length of 
the shop however up the stairs and back again to the window where thompson was 
his forehead bursting with perspiration and his ears red with blood he fairly staggered as 
he neared the machine and dropped the post heavily look what you're doin' said a 
voice behind him it was thompson the lathe worker can't you put that down easy 
no i can't replied eugene angrily his face tinged with a faint blush from his 
extreme exertion he was astonished and enraged to think they should put him to doing 
work like this especially since mr haverford had told him it would be easy he 
suspected at once a plot to drive him away he would have added these are 
too damn heavy for me but he restrained himself he went down stairs wondering how 
he was to get up the others he fingered about the pole gingerly hoping that 
the time taken this way would ease his pain and give him strength for the 
next one finally he picked up another and staggered painfully to the loft again the 
foreman had his eye on him but said nothing it amused him a little to 
think eugene was having such a hard time it wouldn't hurt him for a change 
would do him good when he gets four carried up let him go he said 
to thompson however feeling that he had best lighten the situation a little the latter 
watched eugene out of the tail of his eye noting the grimaces he made and 
the strain he was undergoing but he merely smiled when four had been dropped on 
the floor he said: that'll do for the present and eugene heaving a groan of 
relief went angrily away in his nervous fantastic imaginative and apprehensive frame of mind he 
imagined he had been injured for life he feared he had strained a muscle or 
broken a blood vessel somewhere good heavens i can't stand anything like this he thought 
if the work is going to be this hard i'll have to quit i wonder 
what they mean by treating me this way i didn't come here to do this 
visions of days and weeks of backbreaking toil stretched before him it would never do 
he couldn't stand it he saw his old search for work coming back and this 
frightened him in another direction i mustn't give up so easily he counseled himself in 
spite of his distress i have to stick this out a little while anyhow it 
seemed in this first trying hour as though he were between the devil and the 
deep sea he went slowly down into the yard to find jeffords and duncan they 
were working at a car one inside receiving lumber to be piled the other bringing 
it to him get down bill said john who was on the ground looking up 
at his partner indifferently you get up there new man what's your name witla said 
eugene well my name's duncan we'll bring this stuff to you and you pile it 
it was more heavy lumber as eugene apprehensively observed quarter cut joists for some buildingfour 
by fours they called thembut after he was shown the art of handling them they 
were not unmanageable there were methods of sliding and balancing them which relieved him of 
a great quantity of labor eugene had not thought to provide himself with gloves though 
and his hands were being cruelly torn he stopped once to pick a splinter out 
of his thumb and jeffords who was coming up asked ain't cha got no gloves 
no said eugene i didn't think to get any your hands'll get pretty well bunged 
up i'm afraid maybe joseph'll let you have his for today you might go in 
and ask him where's joseph asked eugene he's inside there he's taking from the plane 
eugene did not understand this quite he knew what a plane was had been listening 
to it sing mightily all the morning the shavings flying as it smoothed the boards 
but taking where's joseph he asked of the plane driver he nodded his head to 
a tall humpshouldered boy of perhaps twentytwo he was a big simple innocent looking fellow 
his face was long and narrow his mouth wide his eyes a watery blue his 
hair a shock of brown loose and wavy with a good sprinkling of sawdust in 
it about his waist was a big piece of hemp bagging tied by a grass 
rope he wore an old faded wool cap with a long visor in order to 
shield his eyes from the flying chips and dust and when eugene came in one 
hand was lifted protectingly to shield his eyes eugene approached him deprecatingly one of the 
men out in the yard said that you might have a pair of gloves you 
would lend me for today i'm piling lumber and it's tearing my hands i forgot 
to get a pair sure said joseph genially waving his hand to the driver to 
stop they're over here in my locker i know what that is i been there 
when i come here they rubbed it into me jist as they're doin' to you 
doncher mind you'll come out all right up here for your health are you it 
ain't always like that somedays there ain't most nothin' to do here then somedays ag'in 
there's a whole lot well it's good healthy work i can say that i ain't 
most never sick nice fresh air we git here and all that he rambled on 
fumbling under his bagging apron for his keys unlocking his locker and producing a great 
pair of old yellow lumber gloves he gave them to eugene cheerfully and the latter 
thanked him he liked eugene at once and eugene liked him a nice fellow that 
he said as he went back to his car think of how genially he gave 
me these lovely if only all men were as genial and kindly disposed as this 
boy how nice the world would be he put on the gloves and found his 
work instantly easier for he could grasp the joists firmly and without pain he worked 
on until noon when the whistle blew and he ate a dreary lunch sitting by 
himself on one side pondering after one he was called to carry shavings one basket 
after another back through the blacksmith shop to the engine room in the rear where 
was a big shaving bin by four o'clock he had seen almost all the characters 
he was going to associate with for the time that he stayed there harry fornes 
the blacksmith or the village smith as eugene came to call him later on jimmy 
sudds the blacksmith's helper or maidofallwork as he promptly named him john peters the engineer 
malachi dempsey the driver of the great plane joseph mews and in addition carpenters tinsmiths 
plumbers painters and those few exceptional cabinet makers who passed through the lower floor now 
and then men who were about the place from time to time and away from 
it at others all of whom took note of eugene at first as a curiosity 
eugene was himself intensely interested in the men harry fornes and jimmy sudds attracted him 
especially the former was an undersized american of distant irish extraction who was so broad 
chested swollen armed squarejawed and generally selfreliant and forceful as to seem a minor titan 
he was remarkably industrious turning out a great deal of work and beating a piece 
of iron with a resounding lick which could be heard all about the hills and 
hollows outside jimmy sudds his assistant was like his master equally undersized dirty gnarled twisted 
his teeth showing like a row of yellow snags his ears standing out like small 
fans his eye askew but nevertheless with so genial a look in his face as 
to disarm criticism at once every body liked jimmy sudds because he was honest singleminded 
and free of malicious intent his coat was three and his trousers two times too 
large for him and his shoes were obviously bought at a secondhand store but he 
had the vast merit of being a picture eugene was fascinated with him he learned 
shortly that jimmy sudds truly believed that buffaloes were to be shot around buffalo new 
york john peters the engineer was another character who fixed his attention john was almost 
helplessly fat and was known for this reason as big john he was a veritable 
whale of a man six feet tall weighing over three hundred pounds and standing these 
summer days in his hot engine room his shirt off his suspenders down his great 
welts of fat showing through his thin cotton undershirt he looked as though he might 
be suffering but he was not john as eugene soon found out did not take 
life emotionally he stood mostly in his engine room door when the shade was there 
staring out on the glistening water of the river occasionally wishing that he didn't need 
to work but could lie and sleep indefinitely instead wouldja think them fellers would feel 
purty good sittin' out there on the poop deck of them there yachts smokin' their 
perfectos he once asked eugene apropos of the magnificent private vessels that passed up and 
down the river i certainly would laughed eugene aw haw that's the life fer yer 
uncle dudley i could do that there with any of 'em aw haw eugene laughed 
joyously yes that's the life he said we all could stand our share malachi dempsey 
the driver of the great plane was dull tightmouthed silent more from lack of ideas 
than anything else though oysterwise he had learned to recede from all manner of harm 
by closing his shell tightly he knew no way to avoid earthly harm save by 
being preternaturally silent and eugene saw this quickly he used to stare at him for 
long periods at a time marvelling at the curiosity his attitude presented eugene himself though 
was a curiosity to the others even more so than they to him he did 
not look like a workingman and could not be made to do so his spirit 
was too high his eye too flashing and incisive he smiled at himself carrying basketful 
after basketful of shavings from the planing room where it rained shavings and from which 
because of the lack of a shaving blower they had to be removed back to 
the hot engine room where big john presided the latter took a great fancy to 
eugene but something after the fashion of a dog for a master he did not 
have a single idea above his engine his garden at home his wife his children 
and his pipe these and sleeplots of itwere his joys his recreations the totality of 
his world chapter xxi there were many days now three months all told in which 
eugene obtained insight into the workaday world such as he had not previously had it 
is true he had worked before in somewhat this fashion but his chicago experience was 
without the broad philosophic insight which had come to him since formerly the hierarchies of 
power in the universe and on earth were inexplicable to himall out of order but 
here where he saw by degrees ignorant almost animal intelligence being directed by greater shrewder 
and at times it seemed to him possibly malicious intelligenceshe was not quite sure about 
thatwho were so strong that the weaker ones must obey them he began to imagine 
that in a rough way life might possibly be ordered to the best advantage even 
under this system it was true that men quarreled here with each other as to 
who should be allowed to lead there was here as elsewhere great seeking for the 
privileges and honors of direction and leadership in such petty things as the proper piling 
of lumber the planing of boards the making of desks and chairs and men were 
grimly jealous of their talents and abilities in these respects but in the main it 
was the jealousy that makes for ordered intelligent control all were striving to do the 
work of intelligence not of unintelligence their pride however ignorant it might be was in 
the superior not the inferior they might complain of their work snarl at each other 
snarl at their bosses but after all it was because they were not able or 
permitted to do the higher work and carry out the orders of the higher mind 
all were striving to do something in a better way a superior way and to 
obtain the honors and emoluments that come from doing anything in a superior way if 
they were not rewarded according to their estimate of their work there was wrath and 
opposition and complaint and selfpity but the work of the superior intelligence was the thing 
which each in his blind selfseeking way was apparently trying to do because he was 
not so far out of his troubles that he could be forgetful of them and 
because he was not at all certain that his talent to paint was ever coming 
back to him he was not as cheerful at times as he might have been 
but he managed to conceal it pretty well this one thought with its attendant ills 
of probable poverty and obscurity were terrible to him time was slipping away and youth 
but when he was not thinking of this he was cheerful enough besides he had 
the ability to simulate cheerfulness even when he did not feel it because he did 
not permanently belong to this world of day labor and because his position which had 
been given him as a favor was moderately secure he felt superior to everything about 
him he did not wish to show this feeling in any waywas very anxious as 
a matter of fact to conceal it but his sense of superiority and ultimate indifference 
to all these petty details was an abiding thought with him he went to and 
fro carrying a basket of shavings jesting with the village smith making friends with big 
john the engineer with joseph malachi dempsey little jimmy sudds in fact anyone and everyone 
who came near him who would be friends he took a pencil one day at 
the noon hour and made a sketch of harry fornes the blacksmith his arm upraised 
at the anvil his helper jimmy sudds standing behind him the fire glowing in the 
forge fornes who was standing beside him looking over his shoulder could scarcely believe his 
eyes wotcha doin' he asked eugene curiously looking over his shoulder for it was at 
the blacksmith's table in the sun of his window that he was sitting looking out 
at the water eugene had bought a lunch box and was carrying with him daily 
a delectable lunch put up under mrs hibberdell's direction he had eaten his noonday meal 
and was idling thinking over the beauty of the scene his peculiar position the curiosities 
of this shopanything and everything that came into his head wait a minute he said 
genially for he and the smith were already as thick as thieves the latter gazed 
interestedly and finally exclaimed: w'y that's me ain't it yep said eugene wat are you 
goin' to do with that wen you get through with it asked the latter avariciously 
i'm going to give it to you of course say i'm much obliged fer that 
replied the smith delightedly gee the wife'll be tickled to see that you're a artist 
ain't cher i hearda them fellers i never saw one gee that's good that looks 
just like me don't it something said eugene quietly still working the helper came in 
watcha' doin' he asked he's drawin' a pitcher ya rube watchye suppose he's doin' informed 
the blacksmith authoritatively don't git too close he's gotta have room aw whose crowdin' asked 
the helper irritably he realized at once that his superior was trying to shove him 
in the background this being a momentous occasion he did not propose that any such 
thing should happen the blacksmith glared at him irritably but the progress of the art 
work was too exciting to permit of any immediate opportunities for hostilities so jimmy was 
allowed to crowd close and see ho ho that's you ain't it he asked the 
smith curiously indicating with a grimy thumb the exact position of that dignitary on the 
drawing don't said the latter loftilysure he's gotta have room an' there's me ho ho 
gee i look swell don't i ho ho the little helper's tushes were showing joyouslya 
smile that extended far about either side of his face he was entirely unconscious of 
the rebuke administered by the smith if you're perfectly good jimmy observed eugene cheerfully still 
working i may make a sketch of you sometime na will you go on say 
hully chee dat'll be fine won't it say ho ho de folks at home won't 
know me i'd like to have a ting like dat say eugene smiled the smith 
was regretful this dividing of honors was not quite all that it might be still 
his own picture was delightful it looked exactly like the shop eugene worked until the 
whistle blew and the belts began to slap and the wheels to whirr then he 
got up there you are fornes he said like it gee it's swell said the 
latter and carried it to the locker he took it out after a bit though 
and hung it up over his bench on the wall opposite his forge for he 
wanted everyone to see it was one of the most significant events in his life 
this sketch was the subject immediately of a perfect storm of discussion eugene was an 
artistcould draw picturesthat was a revelation in itself then this picture was so lifelike it 
looked like fornes and sudds and the shop everyone was interested everyone jealous they could 
not understand how god had favored the smith in this manner why hadn't eugene sketched 
them before he did him why didn't he immediately offer to sketch them now big 
john came first tipped off and piloted by jimmy sudds say he said his big 
round eyes popping with surprise there's some class to that what that looks like you 
fornes jinged if it don't an' suddsy bless me if there ain't suddsy say there 
you are kid natural as life damned if you ain't that's fine you oughta keep 
that smith i intend to said the latter proudly big john went back to his 
engine room regretfully next came joseph mews his shoulders humped his head bobbing like a 
duck for he had this habit of nodding when he walked say wot d'ye thinka 
that he asked ain't that fine he kin drawr jist as good as they do 
in them there magazines i see them there things in them now an' then ain't 
that swell lookit suddsy back in there eh suddsy you're in right all right i 
wisht he'd make a picture o' us out there we're just as good as you 
people wats the matter with us eh oh he ain't goin' to be bothered makin' 
pitchers of you mokes replied the smith jestingly he only draws real ones you want 
to remember that mews he's gotta have good people to make sketches of none o' 
your halfclass planedrivers and jigsaw operators is that so is that so replied joseph contemptuously 
his love of humor spurred by the slight cast upon his ability well if he 
was lookin' for real ones he made a mistake wen he come here they're all 
up front you don't want to forget that smith they don't live in no blacksmith's 
shop as i ever seen it cut it out cut it out called little sudds 
from a position of vantage near the door here comes the boss and joseph immediately 
pretended to be going to the engine room for a drink the smith blew up 
his fire as though it were necessary to heat the iron he had laid in 
the coals jack stix came ambling by who did that he asked stopping after a 
single general glance and looking at the sketch on the wall mr witla the new 
man replied the smith reverently say that's pretty good ain't it the foreman replied pleasantly 
he did that well he must be an artist i think he is replied the 
smith cautiously he was always eager to curry favor with the boss he came near 
to his side and looked over his arm he done it here today at noon 
in about a half an hour say that's pretty good now and the foreman went 
on his way thinking if eugene could do that why was he here it must 
be his run down condition sure enough and he must be the friend of someone 
high in authority he had better be civil hitherto he had stood in suspicious awe 
of eugene not knowing what to make of him he could not figure out just 
why he was herea spy possibly now he thought that he might be mistaken don't 
let him work too hard he told bill and john he ain't any too strong 
yet he came up here for his health he was obeyed in this respect for 
there was no gainsaying the wishes of a foreman but this open plea for consideration 
was the one thing if any which could have weakened eugene's popularity the men did 
not like the foreman he would have been stronger at any time in the affections 
of the men if the foreman had been less markedly considerate or against him entirely 
the days which followed were restful enough though hard for eugene found that the constant 
whirl of work which went on here and of which he had naturally to do 
his share was beneficial to him for the first time in several years he slept 
soundly he would don his suit of blue overalls and jumper in the morning a 
few minutes before the whistle blew at seven and from then on until noon and 
from one o'clock until six he would carry shavings pile lumber for one or several 
of the men in the yard load or unload cars help big john stoke his 
boilers or carry chips and shavings from the second floor he wore an old hat 
which he had found in a closet at mrs hibberdell's a faded crumpled memory of 
a soft tancolored sombrero which he punched jauntily to a peak and wore over one 
ear he had big new yellow gloves which he kept on his hands all day 
which were creased and frayed but plenty good enough for this shop and yard he 
learned to handle lumber nicely to pile with skill to take for malachi dempsey from 
the plane to drive the jigsaw and other curious bits he was tireless in his 
energy because he was weary of thinking and hoped by sheer activity to beat down 
and overcome his notion of artistic inabilityto forget that he believed that he couldn't paint 
and so be able to paint again he had surprised himself in these sketches he 
had made for his first feeling under the old régime would have been that he 
could not make them here because the men were so eager and he was so 
much applauded he found it rather easy and strange to say he thought they were 
good at the home of mrs hibberdell at night he would lay off all his 
working clothes before dinner take a cold bath and don a new brown suit which 
because of the assurance of this position he had bought for eighteen dollars ready made 
he found it hard to get off to buy anything for his pay ceased fifteen 
cents an hour the moment he left the shop he had put his pictures in 
storage in new york and could not get off or at least did not want 
to take the time off to go and sell any he found that he could 
leave without question if he wanted no pay but if he wanted pay and had 
a good reason he could sometimes be excused his appearance about the house and yard 
after sixthirty in the evening and on sundays was attractive enough he looked delicate refined 
conservative and when not talking to someone rather wistful he was lonely and restless for 
he felt terribly out of it this house was lonely as at alexandria before he 
met frieda he was wishing there were some girls about he wondered where frieda was 
what she was doing whether she had married he hoped not if life had only 
given him a girl like friedaso young so beautiful he would sit and gaze at 
the water after dark in the moonlight for this was his one consolationthe beauty of 
naturethinking how lovely it all was how lovely life wasthis village the summer trees the 
shop where he worked the water joseph little jimmy big john the stars if he 
could paint again if he could be in love again in love in love was 
there any other sensation in the world like that of being in love a spring 
evening say some soft sweet odours blowing as they were tonight the dark trees bending 
down or the twilight angelically silver hyacinth orange some soothing murmurs of the wind some 
faint chirping of the treetoads or frogs and then your girl dear god could anything 
be finer than that was anything else in life worth while your girl her soft 
young arms about your neck her lips to yours in pure love her eyes speaking 
like twin pools of color here in the night so had it been only a 
little while ago with frieda so had it been once with angela so long ago 
with stella dear sweet stella how nice she was and now here he was sick 
and lonely and married and angela would be coming back soonandhe would get up frequently 
to shut out these thoughts and either read or walk or go to bed but 
he was lonely almost irritably so there was only one true place of comfort for 
eugene anywhere and that was in the spring time in love chapter xxii it was 
while he was mooning along in this mood working dreaming wishing that there came one 
day to her mother's house at riverwood carlotta wilsonmrs norman wilson in the world in 
which she moveda tall brunette of thirtytwo handsome after the english fashion shapely graceful with 
a knowledge of the world which was not only compounded of natural intelligence and a 
sense of humor but experiences fortunate and unfortunate which had shown her both the showy 
and the seamy sides of life to begin with she was the wife of a 
gamblera professional gamblerof that peculiar order which essays the rôle of a gentleman looks the 
part and fleeces unmercifully the unwary partakers of their companionship carlotta hibberdell living with her 
mother at that time in springfield massachusetts had met him at a local series of 
races which she was attending with her father and mother where wilson happened to be 
accidentally upon another mission her father a real estate dealer and fairly successful at one 
time was very much interested in racing horses and owned several of worthy records though 
of no great fame norman wilson had posed as a real estate speculator himself and 
had handled several fairly successful deals in land but his principal skill and reliance was 
in gambling he was familiar with all the gambling opportunities of the city knew a 
large circle of those who liked to gamble men and women in new york and 
elsewhere and his luck or skill at times was phenomenal at other times it was 
very bad there were periods when he could afford to live in the most expensive 
apartment houses dine at the best restaurants visit the most expensive country pleasure resorts and 
otherwise disport himself in the companionship of friends at other times because of bad luck 
he could not afford any of these things and though he held to his estate 
grimly had to borrow money to do it he was somewhat of a fatalist in 
his interpretation of affairs and would hang on with the faith that his luck would 
turn it did turn invariably of course for when difficulties began to swarm thick and 
fast he would think vigorously and would usually evolve some idea which served to help 
him out his plan was always to spin a web like a spider and await 
the blundering flight of some unwary fly at the time she married him carlotta hibberdell 
did not know of the peculiar tendencies and subtle obsession of her ardent lover like 
all men of his type he was suave persuasive passionate eager there was a certain 
catlike magnetism about him also which fascinated her she could not understand him at that 
time and she never did afterwards the license which he subsequently manifested not only with 
her but with others astonished and disgusted her she found him selfish domineering outside his 
own particular field shallow not at all artistic emotional or poetic he was inclined to 
insist on the last touch of material refinement in surroundings so far as he understood 
them when he had money but she found to her regret that he did not 
understand them in his manner with her and everyone else he was toplofty superior condescending 
his stilted language at times enraged and at other times amused her and when her 
original passion passed and she began to see through his pretence to his motives and 
actions she became indifferent and then weary she was too big a woman mentally to 
quarrel with him much she was too indifferent to life in its totality to really 
care her one passion was for an ideal lover of some type and having been 
thoroughly mistaken in him she looked abroad wondering whether there were any ideal men various 
individuals came to their apartments there were gamblers blasé society men mining experts speculators sometimes 
with sometimes without a wife from these and from her husband and her own observation 
she learned of all sorts of scoundrels mesalliances [sic] queer manifestations of incompatibility of temper 
queer freaks of sex desire because she was good looking graceful easy in her manners 
there were no end of proposals overtures hints and luring innuendos cast in her direction 
she had long been accustomed to them because her husband deserted her openly for other 
women and confessed it in a blasé way she saw no valid reason for keeping 
herself from other men she chose her lovers guardedly and with subtle taste beginning after 
mature deliberation with one who pleased her greatly she was seeking refinement emotion understanding coupled 
with some ability and they were not so easy to find the long record of 
her liaisons is not for this story but their impress on her character was important 
she was indifferent in her manner at most times and to most people a good 
jest or story drew from her a hearty laugh she was not interested in books 
except those of a very exceptional characterthe realistic schooland these she thought ought not to 
be permitted except to private subscribers nevertheless she cared for no others art was fascinatingreally 
great art she loved the pictures of rembrandt frans hals correggio titian and with less 
discrimination and more from a sensual point of view the nudes of cabanel bouguereau and 
gerome to her there was reality in the works of these men lightened by great 
imagination mostly people interested her the vagaries of their minds the idiosyncrasies of their characters 
their lies their subterfuges their pretences their fears she knew that she was a dangerous 
woman and went softly like a cat wearing a halfsmile not unlike that seen on 
the lips of monna lisa but she did not worry about herself she had too 
much courage at the same time she was tolerant generous to a fault charitable when 
someone suggested that she overdid the tolerance she replied why shouldn't i i live in 
such a magnificent glass house the reason for her visit home on this occasion was 
that her husband had practically deserted her for the time being he was in chicago 
for some reason principally because the atmosphere in new york was getting too hot for 
him as she suspected because she hated chicago and was weary of his company she 
refused to go with him he was furious for he suspected her of liaisons but 
he could not help himself she was indifferent besides she had other resources than those 
he represented or could get them a certain wealthy jew had been importuning her for 
years to get a divorce in order that he might marry her his car and 
his resources were at her command but she condescended only the vaguest courtesies it was 
within the ordinary possibilities of the day for him to call her up and ask 
if he could not come with his car he had three she waved most of 
this aside indifferently what's the use was her pet inquiry her husband was not without 
his car at times she had means to drive when she pleased dress as she 
liked and was invited to many interesting outings her mother knew well of her peculiar 
attitude her marital troubles her quarrels and her tendency to flirt she did her best 
to keep her in check for she wanted to retain for her the privilege of 
obtaining a divorce and marrying again the next time successfully norman wilson however would not 
readily give her a legal separation even though the preponderance of evidence was against him 
and if she compromised herself there would be no hope she half suspected that her 
daughter might already have compromised herself but she could not be sure carlotta was too 
subtle norman made open charges in their family quarrels but they were based largely on 
jealousy he did not know for sure carlotta wilson had heard of eugene she did 
not know of him by reputation but her mother's guarded remarks in regard to him 
and his presence the fact that he was an artist that he was sick and 
working as a laborer for his health aroused her interest she had intended to spend 
the period of her husband's absence at narragansett with some friends but before doing so 
she decided to come home for a few days just to see for herself instinctively 
her mother suspected curiosity on her part in regard to eugene she threw out the 
remark that he might not stay long in the hope that her daughter might lose 
interest his wife was coming back carlotta discerned this oppositionthis desire to keep her away 
she decided that she would come i don't know that i want to go to 
narragansett just now she told her mother i'm tired norman has just worn my nerves 
to a frazzle i think i'll come up home for a week or so all 
right said her mother but do be careful how you act now this mr witla 
appears to be a very nice man and he's happily married don't you go casting 
any looks in his direction if you do i won't let him stay here at 
all oh how you talk replied carlotta irritably do give me a little credit for 
something i'm not going up there to see him i'm tired i tell you if 
you don't want me to come i won't it isn't that i do want you 
but you know how you are how do you ever expect to get free if 
you don't conduct yourself circumspectly you know that you oh for heaven's sake i hope 
you're not going to start that old argument again exclaimed carlotta defensively what's the use 
beginning on that we've been all over it a thousand times i can't go anywhere 
or do anything but what you want to fuss now i'm not coming up there 
to do anything but rest why will you always start in to spoil everything well 
now you know well enough carlotta reiterated her mother oh chuck it i'll not come 
to hell with the house i'll go to narragansett you make me tired her mother 
looked at her tall daughter graceful handsome her black hair parted in rich folds irritated 
and yet pleased with her force and ability if she would only be prudent and 
careful what a figure she might yet become her complexion was like old rosetinted ivory 
her lips the color of dark raspberries her eyes bluish grey wide set large sympathetic 
kindly what a pity she had not married some big worthy man to begin with 
to be tied up to this gambler even though they did live in central park 
west and had a comparatively sumptuous apartment was a wretched thing still it was better 
than poverty or scandal though if she did not take care of herself both might 
ensue she wanted her to come to riverwood for she liked her company but she 
wanted her to behave herself perhaps eugene would save the day he was certainly restrained 
enough in his manner and remarks she went back to riverwood and carlotta the quarrel 
smoothed over followed her eugene did not see her during the day she arrived for 
he was at work and she did not see him as he came in at 
night he had on his old peaked hat and carried his handsome leather lunch box 
jauntily in one hand he went to his room bathed dressed and then out on 
the porch to await the call of the dinner gong mrs hibberdell was in her 
room on the second floor and cousin dave as carlotta called simpson was in the 
back yard it was a lovely twilight he was in the midst of deep thoughts 
about the beauty of the scene his own loneliness the characters at the shopwork angela 
and what not when the screen door opened and she stepped out she had on 
a shortsleeved house dress of spotted blue silk with yellow lace set about the neck 
and the ends of the sleeves her shapely figure beautifully proportioned to her height was 
set in a smooth close fitting corset her hair laid in great braids at the 
back was caught in a brown spangled net she carried herself with thoughtfulness and simplicity 
seeming naturally indifferent eugene rose i'm in your way i think won't you have this 
chair no thanks the one in the corner will do but i might as well 
introduce myself since there isn't anyone here to do it i'm mrs wilson mrs hibberdell's 
daughter you're mr witla yes i answer to that said eugene smiling he was not 
very much impressed at first she seemed nice and he fancied intelligenta little older than 
he would have preferred any woman to be who was to interest him she sat 
down and looked at the water he took his chair and held his peace he 
was not even interested to talk to her she was nice to look at however 
her presence lightened the scene for him i always like to come up here she 
volunteered finally it's so warm in the city these days i don't think many people 
know of this place it's out of the beaten track i enjoy it said eugene 
it's such a rest for me i don't know what i would have done if 
your mother hadn't taken me in it's rather hard to find any place doing what 
i am you've taken a pretty strenuous way to get health i should say she 
observed day labor sounds rough to me do you mind it not at all i 
like it the work is interesting and not so very hard it's all so new 
to me that's what makes it easy i like the idea of being a day 
laborer and associating with laborers it's only because i'm run down in health that i 
worry i don't like to be sick it is bad she replied but this will 
probably put you on your feet i think we're always inclined to look on our 
present troubles as the worst i know i am thanks for the consolation he said 
she did not look at him and he rocked to and fro silently finally the 
dinner gong struck mrs hibberdell came down stairs and they went in the conversation at 
dinner turned on his work for a few moments and he described accurately the personalities 
of john and bill and big john the engineer and little suddsy and harry fornes 
the blacksmith carlotta listened attentively without appearing to for everything about eugene seemed singular and 
exceptional to her she liked his tall spare body his lean hands his dark hair 
and eyes she liked the idea of his dressing as a laboring man in the 
morning working all day in the shop and yet appearing so neat and trim at 
dinner he was easy in his manner apparently lethargic in his movements and yet she 
could feel a certain swift force that filled the room it was richer for his 
presence she understood at a glance that he was an artist in all probability a 
good one he said nothing of that avoided carefully all reference to his art and 
listened attentively she felt though as if he were studying her and everyone else and 
it made her gayer at the same time she had a strong leaning toward him 
what an ideal man to be associated with was one of her repeated thoughts although 
she was about the house for ten days and he met her after the third 
morning not only at dinner which was natural enough but at breakfast which surprised him 
a little he paid not so very much attention to her she was nice very 
but eugene was thinking of another type he thought she was uncommonly pleasant and considerate 
and he admired her style of dressing and her beauty studying her with interest wondering 
what sort of a life she led for from various bits of conversation he overheard 
not only at table but at other times he judged she was fairly well to 
do there was an apartment in central park west card parties automobile parties theatre parties 
and a general sense of peopleacquaintances anyhow who were making money he heard her tell 
of a mining engineer dr rowland of a successful coalmining speculator gerald woods of a 
mrs hale who was heavily interested in copper mines and apparently very wealthy it's a 
pity norman couldn't connect with something like that and make some real money he heard 
her say to her mother one evening he understood that norman was her husband and 
that he probably would be back soon so he kept his distanceinterested and curious but 
hardly more mrs wilson was not so easily baffled however a car appeared one evening 
at the door immediately after dinner a great red touring car and mrs wilson announced 
easily we're going for a little spin after dinner mr witla don't you want to 
come along eugene had never ridden in an automobile at that time i'd be very 
pleased he said for the thought of a lonely evening in an empty house had 
sprung up when he saw it appear there was a chauffeur in chargea gallant figure 
in a brown straw cap and tan duster but mrs wilson manoeuvred for place you 
sit with the driver coz she said to simpson and when her mother stepped in 
she followed after leaving eugene the place to the right of her there must be 
a coat and cap in the locker she said to the chauffeur let mr witla 
have it the latter extracted a spare linen coat and straw cap which eugene put 
on i like automobiling don't you she said to eugene goodnaturedly it's so refreshing if 
there is any rest from care on this earth it's in traveling fast i've never 
ridden before replied eugene simply something about the way he said it touched her she 
felt sorry for him because he appeared lonely and gloomy his indifference to her piqued 
her curiosity and irritated her pride why shouldn't he take an interest in her as 
they sped under leafy lanes up hill and down dale she made out his face 
in the starlight it was pale reflective indifferent these deep thinkers she chided him it's 
terrible to be a philosopher eugene smiled when they reached home he went to his 
room as did all the others to theirs he stepped out into the hall a 
few minutes later to go to the library for a book and found that her 
door which he had to pass was wide open she was sitting back in a 
morris chair her feet upon another chair her skirts slightly drawn up revealing a trim 
foot and ankle she did not stir but looked up and smiled winningly aren't you 
tired enough to sleep he asked not quite yet she smiled he went down stairs 
and turning on a light in the library stood looking at a row of books 
reading the titles he heard a step and there she was looking at the books 
also don't you want a bottle of beer she asked i think there is some 
in the ice box i forgot that you might be thirsty i really don't care 
he said i'm not much for drinks of any kind that's not very sociable she 
laughed let's have the beer then he said she threw herself back languidly in one 
of the big dining room chairs when she had brought the drinks and some swiss 
cheese and crackers and said: i think you'll find some cigarettes on the table in 
the corner if you like he struck her a match and she puffed her cigarette 
comfortably i suppose you find it lonely up here away from all your friends and 
companions she volunteered oh i've been sick so long i scarcely know whether i have 
any he described some of his imaginary ailments and experiences and she listened to him 
attentively when the beer was gone she asked him if he would have more but 
he said no after a time because he stirred wearily she got up your mother 
will think we're running some sort of a midnight game down here he volunteered mother 
can't hear she said her room is on the third floor and besides she doesn't 
hear very well dave don't mind he knows me well enough by now to know 
that i do as i please she stood closer to eugene but still he did 
not see when he moved away she put out the lights and followed him to 
the stairs he's either the most bashful or the most indifferent of men she thought 
but she said softly goodnight pleasant dreams to you and went her way eugene thought 
of her now as a good fellow a little gay for a married woman but 
probably circumspect withal she was simply being nice to him all this was simply because 
as yet he was not very much interested there were other incidents one morning he 
passed her door her mother had already gone down to breakfast and there was the 
spectacle of a smooth shapely arm and shoulder quite bare to his gaze as she 
lay on her pillow apparently unconscious that her door was open it thrilled him as 
something sensuously beautiful for it was a perfect arm another time he saw her of 
an evening just before dinner buttoning her shoes her dress was pulled threequarters of the 
way to her knees and her shoulders and arms were bare for she was still 
in her corset and short skirts she seemed not to know that he was near 
one night after dinner he started to whistle something and she went to the piano 
to keep him company another time he hummed on the porch and she started the 
same song singing with him he drew his chair near the window where there was 
a couch after her mother had retired for the night and she came and threw 
herself on it you don't mind if i lie here she said i'm tired tonight 
not at all i'm glad of your company i'm lonely she lay and stared at 
him smiling he hummed and she sang let me see your palm she said i 
want to learn something he held it out she fingered it temptingly even this did 
not wake him she left for five days because of some necessity in connection with 
her engagements and when she returned he was glad to see her he had been 
lonesome and he knew now that she made the house gayer he greeted her genially 
i'm glad to see you back he said are you really she replied i don't 
believe it why not he asked oh signs omens and portents you don't like women 
very well i fancy don't i no i think not she replied she was charming 
in a soft grayish green satin he noticed that her neck was beautiful and that 
her hair looped itself gracefully upon the back of it her nose was straight and 
fine sensitive because of its thin partitioning walls he followed her into the library and 
they went out on the porch presently he returnedit was ten o'clockand she came also 
davis had gone to his room mrs hibberdell to hers i think i'll read he 
said aimlessly why anything like that she jested never read when you can do anything 
else what else can i do oh lots of things play cards tell fortunes read 
palms drink beer she looked at him wilfully he went to his favorite chair near 
the window side by side with the windowseat couch she came and threw herself on 
it be gallant and fix my pillows for me will you she asked of course 
i will he said he took a pillow and raised her head for she did 
not deign to move is that enough he inquired one more he put his hand 
under the first pillow and lifted it up she took hold of his free hand 
to raise herself when she had it she held it and laughed a curious excited 
laugh it came over him all at once the full meaning of all the things 
she had been doing he dropped the pillow he was holding and looked at her 
steadfastly she relaxed her hold and leaned back languorous smiling he took her left hand 
then her right and sat down beside her in a moment he slipped one arm 
under her waist and bending over put his lips to hers she twined her arms 
about his neck tightly and hugged him close then looking in his eyes she heaved 
a great sigh you love me don't you he asked i thought you never would 
she sighed and clasped him to her again chapter xxiii the form of carlotta wilson 
was perfect her passion eager her subtlety a match for almost any situation she had 
deliberately set out to win eugene because he was attractive to her and because by 
his early indifference he had piqued her vanity and selflove she liked him though liked 
every one of his characteristics and was as proud of her triumph as a child 
with a new toy when he had finally slipped his arm under her waist she 
had thrilled with a burning vibrating thrill throughout her frame and when she came to 
him it was with the eagerness of one wild for his caresses she threw herself 
on him kissed him sensuously scores of times whispered her desire and her affection eugene 
thought now that he saw her through the medium of an awakened passion that he 
had never seen anything more lovely for the time being he forgot frieda angela his 
loneliness the fact that he was working in supposed prudent selfrestraint to effect his recovery 
and gave himself up to the full enjoyment of this situation carlotta was tireless in 
her attentions once she saw that he really cared or imagined he did she dwelt 
in the atmosphere of her passion and affection there was not a moment that she 
was not with or thinking of eugene when either was possible she lay in wait 
for him at every turn gave him every opportunity which her skill could command she 
knew the movements of her mother and cousin to the least fractioncould tell exactly where 
they were how long they were likely to remain how long it would take them 
to reach a certain door or spot from where they were standing her step was 
noiseless her motions and glances significant and interpretative for a month or thereabouts she guided 
eugene through the most perilous situations keeping her arms about him to the last possible 
moment kissing him silently and swiftly at the most unexpected times and in the most 
unexpected surroundings her weary languor her seeming indifference disappeared and she was very much aliveexcept 
in the presence of others there her old manner remained intensified even for she was 
determined to throw a veil of darkness over her mother and her cousin's eyes she 
succeeded admirably for the time being for she lied to her mother out of the 
whole cloth pretending that eugene was nice but a little slow so far as the 
ways of the world were concerned he may be a good artist she volunteered but 
he isn't very much of a ladies' man he hasn't the first trace of gallantry 
mrs hibberdell was glad at least there would be no disturbance here she feared carlotta 
feared eugene but she saw no reason for complaint in her presence all was seemingly 
formal and at times almost distant she did not like to say to her daughter 
that she should not come to her own home now that eugene was here and 
she did not like to tell him to leave carlotta said she liked him fairly 
well but that was nothing any married woman might do that yet under her very 
eyes was going forward the most disconcerting license she would have been astounded if she 
had known the manner in which the bath carlotta's chamber and eugene's room were being 
used the hour never struck when they were beyond surveillance but what they were together 
eugene grew very indifferent in the matter of his work from getting to the point 
where he was enjoying it because he looked upon it as a form of exercise 
which was benefiting him and feeling that he might not have to work indefinitely if 
he kept up physical rehabilitation at this pace he grew languid about it and moody 
over the time he had to give to it carlotta had the privilege of a 
certain automobile and besides she could afford to hire one of her own she began 
by suggesting that he meet her at certain places and times for a little spin 
and this took him away from his work a good portion of the time you 
don't have to work every day do you she asked him one sunday afternoon when 
they were alone simpson and mrs hibberdell had gone out for a walk and they 
were in her room on the second floor her mother's was on the third i 
don't have to he said if i don't mind losing the money they pay it's 
fifteen cents an hour and i need that i'm not working at my regular profession 
you must remember oh chuck that she said what's fifteen cents an hour i'll give 
you ten times that to come and be with me no you won't he said 
you won't give me anything we won't go anywhere on that basis oh eugene how 
you talk why won't you she asked i have lots of itat least lots more 
than you have just now and it might as well be spent this way as 
some other it won't be spent right anyhowthat is not for any exceptional purpose why 
shouldn't you have some of it you can pay it back to me i won't 
do it said eugene we won't go anywhere on that basis i'd rather go and 
work it's all right though i can sell a picture maybe i expect to hear 
any day of something being sold what is it you want to do i want 
you to come automobiling with me tomorrow ma is going over to her sister ella's 
in brooklyn has that shop of yours a phone sure it has i don't think 
you'd better call me up there though once wouldn't hurt well perhaps not but we'd 
better not begin that or at least not make a practice of it these people 
are very strict they have to be i know said carlotta i won't i was 
just thinking i'll let you know you know that river road that runs on the 
top of the hill over there yes you be walking along there tomorrow at one 
o'clock and i'll pick you up you can come this once can't you sure said 
eugene i can come i was just joking i can get some money he had 
still his hundred dollars which he had not used when he first started looking for 
work he had been clinging to it grimly but now in this lightened atmosphere he 
thought he might spend some of it he was going to get well everything was 
pointing that way his luck was with him well i'll get the car you don't 
mind riding in that do you no he said i'll wear a good suit to 
the shop and change over there she laughed gaily for his scruples and simplicity amused 
her you're a princemy prince charming she said and she flung herself in his lap 
oh you angel man heavenborn i've been waiting for you i don't know how long 
wise man prince charming i love you i love you i think you're the nicest 
thing that ever was eugene caressed her gently and you're my wise girl but we 
are no good neither you nor i you're a wastrel and a stray and ii 
hesitate to think what i am what is a wastrel she asked that's a new 
one on me i don't remember something or someone that can be thrown away as 
useless a stray is a pigeon that won't stay with the flock that's me said 
carlotta holding out her firm smooth arms before her and grinning mischievously i won't stay 
with any flock nix for the flocks i'd rather be off with my wise man 
he is nice enough for me he's better nor nine or ten flocks she was 
using corrupt english for the joy of it just me and you prince charming am 
i your lovely wastrel do you like strays say you do listen do you like 
strays eugene had been turning his head away saying scandalous terrible you're the worst ever 
but she stopped his mouth with her lips do you this wastrel yes this stray 
he replied smoothing her cheek ah you're lovely carlotta you're beautiful what a wonderful woman 
you are she gave herself to him completely whatever i am i'm yours wise man 
she went on you can have anything you want of me do anything you please 
with me you're like an opiate to me eugene sweet you stop my mouth and 
close my eyes and seal my ears you make me forget everything i suppose i 
might think now and then but i don't want to i don't want to and 
i don't care i wish you were single i wish i were free i wish 
we had an island somewhere together oh hell life is a wearisome tangle isn't it 
'take the cash and let the credit go' by this time carlotta had heard enough 
of eugene's life to understand what his present condition was she knew he was sick 
though not exactly why she thought it was due to overwork she knew he was 
out of funds except for certain pictures he had on sale but that he would 
regain his art ability and reestablish himself she did not doubt she knew something of 
angela and thought it was all right that she should be away from him but 
now she wished the separation might be permanent she went into the city and asking 
about at various art stores learned something of eugene's art history and his great promise 
it made him all the more fascinating in her eyes one of his pictures on 
exhibition at pottle frères was bought by her after a little while and the money 
sent to eugene for she had learned from him how these pictures any pictures were 
exhibited on sale and the painter paid minus the commission when the sale was made 
she took good care to make it clear to the manager at pottle frères that 
she was doing this so that eugene could have the money and saw to it 
that the check reached him promptly if eugene had been alone this check of three 
hundred dollars would have served to bring angela to him as it was it gave 
him funds to disport himself with in her company he did not know that she 
had been the means of his getting it or to whom the picture had been 
sold a fictitious name was given this sale somewhat restored eugene's faith in his future 
for if one of his pictures would sell so late in the day for this 
price others would there were days thereafter of the most curious composition in the morning 
he would leave dressed in his old working suit and carrying his lunch box carlotta 
waving him a farewell from her window or if he had an engagement outside with 
carlotta wearing a good suit and trusting to his overalls and jumper to protect it 
working all day with john and bill or malachi dempsey and josephfor there was rivalry 
between these two groups as to which should have his companyor leaving the shop early 
and riding with her a part of the time coming home at night to be 
greeted by carlotta as though she had not seen him at all she watched for 
his coming as patiently as a wife and was as eager to see if there 
was anything she could do for him in the shop malachi and joseph or john 
and bill and sometimes some of the carpenters up stairs would complain of a rush 
of work in order that they might have his assistance or presence malachi and joseph 
could always enter the complaint that they were in danger of being hampered by shavings 
for the latter were constantly piling up in great heaps beautiful shavings of ash and 
yellow pine and walnut which smelled like resin and frankincense and had the shape of 
girl's curls or dry breakfast food or rich damp sawdust or john and bill would 
complain that they were being overworked and needed someone in the car to receive even 
big john the engineer tried to figure out some scheme by which he could utilize 
eugene as a fireman but that was impossible there was no call for any such 
person the foreman understood well enough what the point was but said nothing placing eugene 
with the particular group which seemed to need him most eugene was genial enough about 
the matter wherever he was was right he liked to be in the cars or 
on a lumber pile or in the plane room he also liked to stand and 
talk to big john or harry fornes his basket under his armkidding as he called 
it his progress to and fro was marked by endless quips and jests and he 
was never weary when his work was done at night he would hurry home following 
the right bank of the little stream until he reached a path which led up 
to the street whereon was the hibberdell house on his way he would sometimes stop 
and study the water its peaceful current bearing an occasional stick or straw upon its 
bosom and contrasting the seeming peace of its movement with his own troubled life the 
subtlety of nature as expressed in water appealed to him the difference between this idyllic 
stream bank and his shop and all who were of it struck him forcefully malachi 
dempsey had only the vaguest conception of the beauty of nature jack stix was scarcely 
more artistic than the raw piles of lumber with which he dealt big john had 
no knowledge of the rich emotions of love or of beauty which troubled eugene's brain 
they lived on another plane apparently and at the other end of the stream awaiting 
him was carlotta graceful sophisticated eager in her regard for him lukewarm in her interest 
in morals sybaritic in her moods representing in a way a world which lived upon 
the fruits of this exploited toil and caring nothing about it if he said anything 
to carlotta about the condition of joseph mews who carried bundles of wood home to 
his sister of an evening to help save the expense of fuel she merely smiled 
if he talked of the poverty of the masses she said don't be doleful eugene 
she wanted to talk of art and luxury and love or think of them at 
least her love of the beauty of nature was keen there were certain inns they 
could reach by automobile where they could sit and dine and drink a bottle of 
wine or a pitcher of claret cup and here she would muse on what they 
would do if they were only free angela was frequently in carlotta's thoughts persistently in 
eugene's for he could not help feeling that he was doing her a rank injustice 
she had been so patient and affectionate all this long time past had tended him 
as a mother waited on him as a servant only recently he had been writing 
in most affectionate terms wishing she were with him now all that was dead again 
it was hard work to write everything he said seemed a lie and he did 
not want to say it he hated to pretend still if he did not write 
angela would be in a state of mortal agony he thought and would shortly come 
to look him up it was only by writing protesting his affection explaining why in 
his judgment it was unadvisable for her to come at present that she could be 
made to stay where she was and now that he was so infatuated with carlotta 
this seemed very desirable he did not delude himself that he would ever be able 
to marry her he knew that he could not get a divorce there being no 
grounds and the injustice to angela being such a bar to his conscience and as 
for carlotta her future was very uncertain norman wilson for all that he disregarded her 
at times did not want to give her up he was writing threatening to come 
back to new york if she did not come to him though the fact that 
she was in her mother's home where he considered her safe was some consolation to 
him angela was begging eugene to let her come they would get along she argued 
on whatever he got and he would be better off with her than alone she 
pictured him living in some uncomfortable boarding house where he was not half attended to 
and intensely lonely her return meant the leaving of this lovely homefor mrs hibberdell had 
indicated that she would not like to keep him and his wifeand so the end 
of this perfect romance with carlotta an end to lovely country inns and summer balconies 
where they were dining together an end to swift tours in her automobile which she 
guided skilfully herself avoiding the presence of a chauffeur an end to lovely trysts under 
trees and by pretty streams where he kissed and fondled her and where she lingered 
joyously in his arms if ma could only see us now she would jest or 
do you suppose bill and john would recognize you here if they saw you once 
she said: this is better than the engine room isn't it you're a bad lot 
carlotta he would declare and then would come to her lips the enigmatic smile of 
monna lisa you like bad lots don't you strays make fine hunting in her own 
philosophy she was taking the cash and letting the credit go chapter xxiv days like 
this could not go on forever the seed of their destruction was in their beginning 
eugene was sad he used to show his mood at times and if she asked 
him what was the matter would say: we can't keep this thing up much longer 
it must come to an end soon you're certainly a gloomy philosopher genie she would 
say reproachfully for she had hopes that it could be made to last a long 
while under any circumstances eugene had the feeling that no pretence would escape angela's psychology 
she was too sensitive to his unspoken moods and feelings she would come soon willynilly 
and then all this would be ended as a matter of fact several things combined 
to bring about change and conclusion for one thing mrs hibberdell had been more and 
more impressed with the fact that carlotta was not merely content to stay but that 
once having come she was fairly determined to remain she had her own apartment in 
the city ostensibly closed for the summer for she had protested that it was too 
hot to live in town when she first proposed going to narragansett after seeing eugene 
she figured out a possible use for it though that use was dangerous for norman 
wilson might return at any time nevertheless they had been there on occasionsthis with the 
double effect of deceiving her mother and entertaining eugene if she could remain away from 
riverwood a percentage of the time she argued with eugene it would make her stay 
less suspicious and would not jeopardize their joy in companionship so she did this at 
the same time she could not stay away from riverwood entirely for eugene was there 
necessarily morning and evening nevertheless toward the end of august mrs hibberdell was growing suspicious 
she had seen an automobile entering central park once when carlotta had phoned her that 
she had a sick headache and could not come up it looked to mrs hibberdell 
who had gone down town shopping on the strength of this ailment and who had 
phoned carlotta that she was going to call at her apartment in the evening as 
though eugene and carlotta were in it eugene had gone to work that morning which 
made it seem doubtful but it certainly looked very much like him still she did 
not feel sure it was he or carlotta either when she came to the latter's 
apartment carlotta was there feeling better but stating that she had not been out mrs 
hibberdell concluded thoughtfully that she must have been mistaken her own room was on the 
third floor and several times after all had retired and she had come down to 
the kitchen or dining room or library for something she had heard a peculiar noise 
as of someone walking lightly she thought it was fancy on her part for invariably 
when she reached the second floor all was dark and still nevertheless she wondered whether 
eugene and carlotta could be visiting twice between breakfast and the time eugene departed she 
thought she heard eugene and carlotta whispering on the second floor but there was no 
proof carlotta's readiness to rise for breakfast at sixthirty in order to be at the 
same table with eugene was peculiar and her giving up narragansett for riverwood was most 
significant it remained for one real discovery to resolve all her suspicions into the substance 
of fact and convict carlotta of being the most conscienceless of deceivers it came about 
in this fashion one sunday morning davis and mrs hibberdell had decided to go automobiling 
eugene and carlotta were invited but had refused for carlotta on hearing the discussion several 
days before had warned eugene and planned to have the day for herself and her 
lover she cautioned him to pretend the need of making visits down town as for 
herself she had said she would go but on the day in question did not 
feel well enough davis and mrs hibberdell departed their destination being long island it was 
an all day tour after an hour their machine broke however and after sitting in 
it two hours waiting for repairslong enough to spoil their plansthey came back by trolley 
eugene had not gone down town he was not even dressed when the door opened 
on the ground floor and mrs hibberdell came in oh carlotta she called standing at 
the foot of the stairs and expecting carlotta to appear from her own room or 
a sort of lounging and sewing room which occupied the front of the house on 
the second floor and where she frequently stayed carlotta unfortunately was with eugene and the 
door to this room was commanded from where mrs hibberdell was standing she did not 
dare to answer oh carlotta called her mother again the latter's first thought was to 
go back in the kitchen and look there but on second thoughts she ascended the 
steps and started for the sewing room carlotta thought she had entered in an instant 
she had seized the opportunity to step into the bath which was next to eugene's 
room but she was scarcely quick enough her mother had not gone into the roomonly 
opened the door and looked in she did not see carlotta step out of eugene's 
room but she did see her entering the bath in negligee and she could scarcely 
have come from anywhere else her own door which was between eugene's room and the 
sewing room was ten feet away it did not seem possible that she could have 
come from there: she had not had time enough and anyhow why had she not 
answered the first impulse of mrs hibberdell was to call to her her second thought 
was to let the ruse seem successful she was convinced that eugene was in his 
room and a few moments later a monitory cough on his partcoughed for a purposeconvinced 
her are you in the bath carlotta she called quietly after looking into carlotta's room 
yes came the reply easily enough now did your machine break down a few remarks 
were exchanged through the door and then mrs hibberdell went to her room she thought 
over the situation steadily for it greatly irritated her it was not the same as 
the discovered irregularity of a trusted and virtuous daughter carlotta had not been led astray 
she was a grown woman married experienced in every way she knew as much about 
life as her motherin some respects more the difference between them was in ethical standards 
and the policy that aligns itself with common sense decency self preservation as against its 
opposite carlotta had so much to look out for her future was in her own 
hands besides eugene's future his wife's rights and interests her mother's home her mother's standards 
were things which she ought to respectought to want to respect to find her lying 
as she had been this long time pretending indifference pretending absence and no doubt associating 
with eugene all the while was disgusting she was very angry not so much at 
eugene though her respect for him was greatly lowered artist though he was as at 
carlotta she ought to do better she ought to be ashamed not to guard herself 
against a man like eugene instead of luring him on it was carlotta's fault and 
she determined to reproach her bitterly and to break up this wretched alliance at once 
there was an intense and bitter quarrel the next morning for mrs hibberdell decided to 
hold her peace until eugene and davis should be out of the house she wanted 
to have this out with carlotta alone and the clash came shortly after breakfast when 
both the others had left carlotta had already warned eugene that something might happen on 
account of this but under no circumstances was he to admit anything unless she told 
him to the maid was in the kitchen out of ear shot and mrs hibberdell 
and carlotta were in the library when the opening gun was fired in a way 
carlotta was prepared for she fancied her mother might have seen other thingswhat or how 
much she could not guess she was not without the dignity of a circe for 
she had been through scenes like this before her own husband had charged her with 
infidelity more than once and she had been threatened with physical violence by him her 
face was pale but calm now carlotta observed her mother vigorously i saw what was 
going on yesterday morning when i came home you were in mr witla's room with 
your clothes off i saw you come out please don't deny it i saw you 
come out aren't you ashamed of yourself how can you treat me that way after 
your promise not to do anything out of the way here you didn't see me 
come out of his room and i wasn't in there said carlotta brazenly her face 
was pale but she was giving a fair imitation of righteous surprise why do you 
make any such statement as that why carlotta hibberdell how dare you contradict me how 
dare you lie you came out of that room you know you did you know 
that you were in there you know that i saw you i should think you 
would be ashamed of yourself slipping about this house like a street girl and your 
own mother in it aren't you ashamed of yourself have you no sense of decency 
left oh carlotta i know you are bad but why will you come here to 
be so why couldn't you let this man alone he was doing well enough it's 
a shame the thing you have done it's an outrage mrs witla ought to come 
here and whip you within an inch of your life oh how you talk said 
carlotta irritably you make me tired you didn't see me it's the old storysuspicion you're 
always full of suspicion you didn't see me and i wasn't in there why do 
you start a fuss for nothing a fuss a fuss for nothingthe idea you evil 
woman a fuss for nothing how can you talk that way i can hardly believe 
my senses i can hardly believe you would dare to brazenly face me in this 
way i saw you and now you deny it mrs hibberdell had not seen her 
but she was convinced that what she said was true carlotta brazened it out you 
didn't she insisted mrs hibberdell stared the effrontery of it took her breath away carlotta 
she exclaimed i honestly think you are the worst woman in the world i can't 
think of you as my daughteryou are too brazen you're the worst because you're calculating 
you know what you're doing and you are deliberate in your method of doing it 
you're evilminded you know exactly what you want and you set out deliberately to get 
it you have done it in this case you started out to get this man 
and you have succeeded in doing it you have no sense of shame no pride 
no honesty no honor no respect for me or anyone else you do not love 
this man you know you don't if you did you would never degrade him and 
yourself and me as you have done you've simply indulged in another vile relationship because 
you wanted to and now when you're caught you brazen it out you're evil carlotta 
you're as low as a woman can be even if you are my daughter it 
isn't true said carlotta you're just talking to hear yourself talk it is true and 
you know it reproved her mother you talk about norman he never did a thing 
worse in his life than you have done he may be a gambler and immoral 
and inconsiderate and selfish what are you can you stand there and tell me you're 
any better pah if you only had a sense of shame something could be done 
for you but you haven't any you're just vile that's all how you talk ma 
she observed calmly how you carry on and that on a mere suspicion you didn't 
see me i might have been in there but you didn't see me and i 
wasn't you're making a storm just because you want to i like mr witla i 
think he's very nice but i'm not interested in him and i haven't done anything 
to harm him you can turn him out if you want to that's none of 
my affairs you're simply raging about as usual without any facts to go upon carlotta 
stared at her mother thinking she was not greatly disturbed it was pretty bad no 
doubt of that but she was not thinking so much of that as of the 
folly of being found out her mother knew for certain though she would not admit 
to her that she knew now all this fine summer romance would endthe pleasant convenience 
of it anyhow eugene would be put to the trouble of moving her mother might 
say something disagreeable to him besides she knew she was better than norman because she 
did not associate with the same evil type of people she was not coarse she 
was not thickwitted she was not cruel she was not a user of vile language 
or an expresser of vile ideas and norman was at times she might lie and 
she might be calculating but not to anyone's disadvantageshe was simply passion drivenboldly so and 
only toward love or romance am i evil she often asked herself her mother said 
she was evil well she was in one way but her mother was angry that 
was all she did not mean all she said she would come round still carlotta 
did not propose to admit the truth of her mother's charges or to go through 
this situation without some argument there were charges which her mother was making which were 
untenablepoints which were inexcusable carlotta hibberdell you're the most brazen creature i ever knew you're 
a terrible liar how can you stand there and look me in the eye and 
say that when you know that i know why lie in addition to everything else 
oh carlotta the shame of it if you only had some sense of honor how 
can you lie like that how can you i'm not lying declared carlotta and i 
wish you would quit fussing you didn't see me you know you didn't i came 
out of my room and you were in the front room why do you say 
you weren't you didn't see me supposing i am a liar i'm your daughter i 
may be vile i didn't make myself so certainly i'm not in this instance whatever 
i am i come by it honestly my life hasn't been a bed of roses 
why do you start a silly fight you haven't a thing to go on except 
suspicion and now you want to raise a row i don't care what you think 
of me i'm not guilty in this case and you can think what you please 
you ought to be ashamed to charge me with something of which you are not 
sure she walked to the window and stared out her mother shook her head such 
effrontery was beyond her it was like her daughter though she took after her father 
and herself both were selfwilled and determined when aroused at the same time she was 
sorry for her girl for carlotta was a capable woman in her way and very 
much dissatisfied with life i should think you would be ashamed of yourself carlotta whether 
you admit it to me or not she went on the truth is the truth 
and it must hurt you a little you were in that room we won't argue 
that though you set out deliberately to do this and you have done it now 
what i have to say is this: you are going back to your apartment today 
and mr witla is going to leave here as quick as he can get a 
room somewhere else you're not going to continue this wretched relationship any longer if i 
can help it i'm going to write to his wife and to norman too if 
i can't do anything else to break this up you're going to let this man 
alone you have no right to come between him and mrs witla it's an outrage 
and no one but a vile conscienceless woman would do it i'm not going to 
say anything to him now but he's going to leave here and so are you 
when it's all over you can come back if you want to i'm ashamed for 
you i'm ashamed for myself if it hadn't been for my own feelings and those 
of davis i would have ordered you both out of the house yesterday and you 
know it it's consideration for myself that's made me smooth it over as much as 
i have he the vile thing after all the courtesy i have shown him still 
i don't blame him as much as i do you for he would never have 
looked at you if you hadn't made him my own daughter my own house tch 
tch tch there was more conversationthat fulgurous coruscating reiteration of charges eugene was no good 
carlotta was vile mrs hibberdell wouldn't have believed it possible if she hadn't seen it 
with her own eyes she was going to tell norman if carlotta didn't reformover and 
over one threat after another well she said finally you're going to get your things 
ready and go into the city this afternoon i'm not going to have you here 
another day no i'm not said carlotta boldly pondering over all that had been said 
it was a terrible ordeal but she would not go today i'm going in the 
morning i'm not going to pack that fast it's too late i'm not going to 
be ordered out of here like a servant her mother groaned but she gave in 
carlotta could not be made to do anything she did not want to do she 
went to her room and presently mrs hibberdell heard her singing she shook her head 
such a personality no wonder eugene succumbed to her blandishments what man wouldn't chapter xxv 
the sequel of this scene was not to be waited for at dinner time mrs 
hibberdell announced in the presence of carlotta and davis that the house was going to 
be closed up for the present and very quickly she and carlotta were going to 
narragansett for the month of september and a part of october eugene having been forewarned 
by carlotta took it with a show of polite surprise he was sorry he had 
spent such a pleasant time here mrs hibberdell could not be sure whether carlotta had 
told him or not he seemed so innocent but she assumed that she had and 
that he like carlotta was putting on she had informed davis that for reasons of 
her own she wanted to do this he suspected what they were for he had 
seen signs and slight demonstrations which convinced him that carlotta and eugene had reached an 
understanding he did not consider it anything very much amiss for carlotta was a woman 
of the world her own boss and a good fellow she had always been nice 
to him he did not want to put any obstacles in her way in addition 
he liked eugene once he had said to carlotta jestingly well his arms are almost 
as long as norman'snot quite maybe you go to the devil was her polite reply 
tonight a storm came up a brilliant flashing summer storm eugene went out on the 
porch to watch it carlotta came also well wise man she said as the thunder 
rolled it's all over up here don't let on i'll see you wherever you go 
but this was so nice it was fine to have you near me don't get 
blue will you she says she may write your wife but i don't think she 
will if she thinks i'm behaving she won't i'll try and fool her it's too 
bad though i'm crazy about you genie now that he was in danger of losing 
carlotta her beauty took on a special significance for eugene he had come into such 
close contact with her had seen her under such varied conditions that he had come 
to feel a profound admiration for not only her beauty but her intellect and ability 
as well one of his weaknesses was that he was inclined to see much more 
in those he admired than was really there he endowed them with the romance of 
his own moodssaw in them the ability to do things which he only could do 
in doing this of course he flattered their vanity aroused their selfconfidence made them feel 
themselves the possessors of latent powers and forces which before him they had only dreamed 
of margaret ruby angela christina and carlotta had all gained this feeling from him they 
had a better opinion of themselves for having known him now as he looked at 
carlotta he was intensely sorry for she was so calm so affable so seemingly efficient 
and self reliant and such a comfort to him in these days circe he said 
this is too bad i'm sorry i'm going to hate to lose you you won't 
lose me she replied you can't i won't let you i've found you now and 
i'm going to keep you this don't mean anything we can find places to meet 
get a place where they have a phone if you can when do you think 
you'll go right away said eugene i'll take tomorrow morning off and look poor eugene 
she said sympathetically it's too bad never mind though everything will come out right she 
was still not counting on angela she thought that even if angela came back as 
eugene told her she would soon a joint arrangement might possibly be made angela could 
be here but she carlotta could share eugene in some way she thought she would 
rather live with him than any other man on earth it was only about noon 
the next morning when eugene had found another room for in living here so long 
he had thought of several methods by which he might have obtained a room in 
the first place there was another church a library the postmaster and the ticket agent 
at speonk who lived in the village he went first to the postmaster and learned 
of two families one the home of a civil engineer where he might be welcome 
and it was here that he eventually settled the view was not quite so attractive 
but it was charming and he had a good room and good meals he told 
them that he might not stay long for his wife was coming back soon the 
letters from angela were becoming most importunate he gathered up his belongings at mrs hibberdell's 
and took a polite departure after he was gone mrs hibberdell of course changed her 
mind and carlotta returned to her apartment in new york she communicated with eugene not 
only by phone but by special delivery and had him meet her at a convenient 
inn the second evening of his departure she was planning some sort of a separate 
apartment for them when eugene informed her that angela was already on her way to 
new york and that nothing could be done at present since eugene had left her 
at biloxi angela had spent a most miserable period of seven months she had been 
grieving her heart out for she imagined him to be most lonely and at the 
same time she was regretful that she had ever left him she might as well 
have been with him she figured afterward that she might have borrowed several hundred dollars 
from one of her brothers and carried out the fight for his mental recovery by 
his side once he had gone she fancied she might have made a mistake matrimonially 
for he was so impressionablebut his condition was such that she did not deem him 
to be interested in anything save his recovery besides his attitude toward her of late 
had been so affectionate and in a way dependent all her letters since he had 
left had been most tender speaking of his sorrow at this necessary absence and hoping 
that the time would soon come when they could be together the fact that he 
was lonely finally decided her and she wrote that she was coming whether he wanted 
her to or not her arrival would have made little difference except that by now 
he was thoroughly weaned away from her again had obtained a new ideal and was 
interested only to see and be with carlotta the latter's easy financial state her nice 
clothes her familiarity with comfortable and luxurious thingsbetter things than eugene had ever dreamed of 
enjoyingher use of the automobile her freedom in the matter of expenditurestaking the purchase of 
champagne and expensive meals as a matter of coursedazzled and fascinated him it was rather 
an astonishing thing he thought to have so fine a woman fall in love with 
him besides her tolerance her indifference to petty conventions her knowledge of life and literature 
and artset her in marked contrast to angela and in all ways she seemed rare 
and forceful to him he wished from his heart that he could be free and 
could have her into this peculiar situation angela precipitated herself one bright saturday afternoon in 
september she was dying to see eugene again full of grave thoughts for his future 
she had come to share it whatever it might be her one idea was that 
he was sick and depressed and lonely none of his letters had been cheerful or 
optimistic for of course he did not dare to confess the pleasure he was having 
in carlotta's company in order to keep her away he had to pretend that lack 
of funds made it inadmissible for her to be here the fact that he was 
spending and by the time she arrived had spent nearly the whole of the three 
hundred dollars his picture sold to carlotta had brought him had troubled himnot unduly of 
course or he would not have done it he had qualms of conscience severe ones 
but they passed with the presence of carlotta or the reading of his letters from 
angela i don't know what's the matter with me he said to himself from time 
to time i guess i'm no good he thought it was a blessing that the 
world could not see him as he was one of the particular weaknesses of eugene's 
which should be set forth here and which will help to illuminate the bases of 
his conduct was that he was troubled with a dual point of viewa condition based 
upon a peculiar power of analysisselfanalysis in particular which was constantly permitting him to tear 
himself up by the roots in order to see how he was getting along he 
would daily and hourly when not otherwise employed lift the veil from his inner mental 
processes as he might lift the covering from a well and peer into its depths 
what he saw was not very inviting and vastly disconcerting a piece of machinery that 
was not going as a true man should clock fashion and corresponding in none of 
its moral characteristics to the recognized standard of a man he had concluded by now 
from watching various specimens that sane men were honest some inherently moral some regulated by 
a keen sense of duty and occasionally all of these virtues and others were bound 
up in one man angela's father was such an one m charles appeared to be 
another he had concluded from his association with jerry mathews philip shotmeyer peter machugh and 
joseph smite that they were all rather decent in respect to morals he had never 
seen them under temptation but he imagined they were such a man as william haverford 
the engineer of maintenance of way and henry c litlebrown the division engineer of this 
immense road struck him as men who must have stuck close to a sense of 
duty and the conventions of the life they represented working hard all the time to 
have attained the positions they had all this whole railroad system which he was watching 
closely from day to day from his little vantage point of connection with it seemed 
a clear illustration of the need of a sense of duty and reliability all of 
these men who worked for this company had to be in good health all had 
to appear at their posts on the tick of the clock all had to perform 
faithfully the duties assigned them or there would be disasters most of them had climbed 
by long arduous years of work to very modest positions of prominence as conductors engineers 
foremen division superintendents others more gifted or more blessed by fortune became division engineers superintendents 
vicepresidents and presidents they were all slow climbers rigid in their sense of duty tireless 
in their energy exact thoughtful what was he he looked into the well of his 
being and there he saw nothing but shifty and uncertain currents it was very dark 
down there he was not honest he said to himself except in money mattershe often 
wondered why he was not truthful he was not moral this love of beauty which 
haunted him seemed much more important than anything else in the world and his pursuit 
of that seemed to fly in the face of everything else which was established and 
important he found that men everywhere did not think much of a man who was 
crazy after women they might joke about an occasional lapse as an amiable vice or 
one which could be condoned but they wanted little to do with a man who 
was overpowered by it there was a case over in the railroad yard at speonk 
recently which he had noted of a foreman who had left his wife and gone 
after some hoyden in white plains and because of this offense he was promptly discharged 
it appeared though that before this he had occasionally had such lapses and that each 
time he had been discharged but had been subsequently forgiven this one weakness and no 
other had given him a bad reputation among his fellow railroad menmuch as that a 
drunkard might have big john peters the engineer had expressed it aptly to eugene one 
day when he told him in confidence that ed bowers would go to hell for 
his hide the latter being the local expression for women everybody seemed to pity him 
and the man seemed in a way to pity himself he had a hangdog look 
when he was reinstated and yet everybody knew that apart from this he was a 
fairly competent foreman still it was generally understood that he would never get anywhere from 
that eugene argued to himself that a man who was cursed with this peculiar vice 
could not get anywhere that he if he kept it up would not it was 
like drinking and stealing and the face of the world was against it very frequently 
it went hand in hand with those thingsbirds of a feather he thought still he 
was cursed with it and he no more than ed bowers appeared to be able 
to conquer it at least he was yielding to it now as he had before 
it mattered not that the women he chose were exceptionally beautiful and fascinating they were 
women and ought he to want them he had one he had taken a solemn 
vow to love and cherish her or at least had gone through the formality of 
such a vow and here he was running about with carlotta as he had with 
christina and ruby before her was he not always looking for some such woman as 
this certainly he was had he not far better be seeking for wealth distinction a 
reputation for probity chastity impeccable moral honor certainly he had it was the way to 
distinction apparently assuming the talent and here he was doing anything but take that way 
conscience was his barrier a conscience unmodified by cold selfinterest shame upon himself shame upon 
his weakkneed disposition not to be able to recover from this illusion of beauty such 
were some of the thoughts which his moments of introspection brought him on the other 
hand there came over him that other phase of his dualitythe ability to turn his 
terrible searchlight of intelligence which swept the heavens and the deep as with a great 
white rayupon the other side of the question it revealed constantly the inexplicable subtleties and 
seeming injustices of nature he could not help seeing how the big fish fed upon 
the little ones the strong were constantly using the weak as pawns the thieves the 
grafters the murderers were sometimes allowed to prey on society without let or hindrance good 
was not always rewardedfrequently terribly illrewarded evil was seen to flourish beautifully at times it 
was all right to say that it would be punished but would it carlotta did 
not think so she did not think the thing she was doing with him was 
very evil she had said to him over and over that it was an open 
question that he was troubled with an ingrowing conscience i don't think it's so bad 
she once told him it depends somewhat on how you were raised there was a 
system apparently in society but also apparently it did not work very well only fools 
were held by religion which in the main was an imposition a graft and a 
lie the honest man might be very fine but he wasn't very successful there was 
a great todo about morals but most people were immoral or unmoral why worry look 
to your health don't let a morbid conscience get the better of you thus she 
counselled and he agreed with her for the rest the survival of the fittest was 
the best why should he worry he had talent it was thus that eugene floundered 
to and fro and it was in this state brooding and melancholy that angela found 
him on her arrival he was as gay as ever at times when he was 
not thinking but he was very thin and holloweyed and angela fancied that it was 
overwork and worry which kept him in this state why had she left him poor 
eugene she had clung desperately to the money he had given her and had most 
of it with her ready to be expended now for his care she was so 
anxious for his recovery and his peace of mind that she was ready to go 
to work herself at anything she could find in order to make his path more 
easy she was thinking that fate was terribly unjust to him and when he had 
gone to sleep beside her the first night she lay awake and cried poor eugene 
to think he should be tried so by fate nevertheless he should not be tortured 
by anything which she could prevent she was going to make him as comfortable and 
happy as she could she set about to find some nice little apartment or rooms 
where they could live in peace and where she could cook eugene's meals for him 
she fancied that maybe his food had not been exactly right and when she got 
him where she could manifest a pretence of selfconfidence and courage that he would take 
courage from her and grow better so she set briskly about her task honeying eugene 
the while for she was confident that this above all things was the thing he 
needed she little suspected what a farce it all appeared to him how mean and 
contemptible he appeared to himself he did not care to be meanto rapidly disillusion her 
and go his way and yet this dual existence sickened him he could not help 
but feel that from a great many points of view angela was better than carlotta 
yet the other woman was wider in her outlook more gracious in her appearance more 
commanding more subtle she was a princess of the world subtle deadly machiavellian but a 
princess nevertheless angela was better described by the current and acceptable phrase of the timea 
thoroughly good woman honest energetic resourceful in all things obedient to the race spirit and 
the conventional feelings of the time he knew that society would support her thoroughly and 
condemn carlotta and yet carlotta interested him more he wished that he might have both 
and no fussing then all would be beautiful so he thought chapter xxvi the situation 
which here presented itself was subject to no such gracious and generous development angela was 
the soul of watchfulness insistence on duty consideration for right conduct and for the privileges 
opportunities and emoluments which belonged to her as the wife of a talented artist temporarily 
disabled it is true but certain to be distinguished in the future she was deluding 
herself that this recent experience of reverses had probably hardened and sharpened eugene's practical instincts 
made him less indifferent to the necessity of looking out for himself given him keener 
instincts of selfprotection and economy he had done very well to live on so little 
she thought but they were going to do betterthey were going to save she was 
going to give up those silly dreams she had entertained of a magnificent studio and 
hosts of friends and she was going to start now saving a fraction of whatever 
they made however small it might be if it were only ten cents a week 
if eugene could only make nine dollars a week by working every day they were 
going to live on that he still had ninetyseven of the hundred dollars he had 
brought with him he told her and this was going in the bank he did 
not tell her of the sale of one of his pictures and of the subsequent 
dissipation of the proceeds in the bank too they were going to put any money 
from subsequent sales until he was on his feet again one of these days if 
they ever made any money they were going to buy a house somewhere in which 
they could live without paying rent some of the money in the bank a very 
little of it might go for clothes if worst came to worst but it would 
not be touched unless it was absolutely necessary she needed clothes now but that did 
not matter to eugene's ninetyseven was added angela's two hundred and twentyeight which she brought 
with her and this total sum of three hundred and twentyfive dollars was promptly deposited 
in the bank of riverwood angela by personal energy and explanation found four rooms in 
the house of a furniture manufacturer it had been vacated by a daughter who had 
married and they were glad to let it to an artist and his wife for 
practically nothing so far as real worth was concerned for this was a private house 
in a lovely lawn twelve dollars per month was the charge mrs witla seemed very 
charming to mrs desenas who was the wife of the manufacturer and for her especial 
benefit a little bedroom on the second floor adjoining a bath was turned into a 
kitchen with a small gas stove and angela at once began housekeeping operations on the 
tiny basis necessitated by their income some furniture had to be secured for the room 
was not completely furnished but angela by haunting the secondhand stores in new york looking 
through all the department stores and visiting certain private sales managed to find a few 
things which she could buy cheaply and which would fit in with the dressing table 
library table dining table and one bed which were already provided the necessary curtains for 
the bath and kitchen windows she cut decorated and hung for herself she went down 
to the storage company where the unsold and undisplayed portion of eugene's pictures were and 
brought back seven which she placed in the general livingroom and diningroom all eugene's clothes 
his underwear and socks particularly received her immediate attention and she soon had his rather 
attenuated wardrobe in good condition from the local market she bought good vegetables and a 
little meat and made delightful stews ragouts combinations of eggs and tasty meat juices after 
the french fashion all her housekeeping art was employed to the utmost to make everything 
look clean and neat to maintain a bountiful supply of varied food on the table 
and yet to keep the cost down so that they could not only live on 
nine dollars a week but set aside a dollar or more of that for what 
angela called their private bank account she had a little hollow brown jug calculated to 
hold fifteen dollars in change which could be opened when full which she conscientiously endeavored 
to fill and refill her one desire was to rehabilitate her husband in the eyes 
of the worldthis time to stayand she was determined to do it for another thing 
reflection and conversation with one person and another had taught her that it was not 
well for herself or for eugene for her to encourage him in his animal passions 
some woman in blackwood had pointed out a local case of locomotorataxia which had resulted 
from lack of selfcontrol and she had learned that it was believed that many other 
nervous troubles sprang from the same source perhaps eugene's had she had resolved to protect 
him from himself she did not believe she could be injured but eugene was so 
sensitive so emotional the trouble with the situation was that it was such a sharp 
change from his recent free and to him delightful mode of existence that it was 
almost painful he could see that everything appeared to be satisfactory to her that she 
thought all his days had been moral and full of hard work carlotta's presence in 
the background was not suspected her idea was that they would work hard together now 
along simple idealistic lines to the one endsuccess for him and of course by reflection 
for her eugene saw the charm of it well enough but it was only as 
something quite suitable for others he was an artist the common laws of existence could 
not reasonably apply to an artist the latter should have intellectual freedom the privilege of 
going where he pleased associating with whom he chose this marriage business was a galling 
yoke cutting off all rational opportunity for enjoyment and he was now after a brief 
period of freedom having that yoke heavily adjusted to his neck again gone were all 
the fine dreams of pleasure and happiness which so recently had been so realthe hope 
of living with carlottathe hope of associating with her on easy and natural terms in 
that superior world which she represented angela's insistence on the thought that he should work 
every day and bring home nine dollars a week or rather its monthly equivalent made 
it necessary for him to take sharp care of the little money he had kept 
out of the remainder of the three hundred in order to supply any deficiency which 
might occur from his taking time off for there was no opportunity now of seeing 
carlotta of an evening and it was necessary to take a regular number of afternoons 
or mornings off each week in order to meet her he would leave the little 
apartment as usual at a quarter to seven in the morning dressed suitably for possible 
outdoor expeditions for in anticipation of difficulty he had told angela that it was his 
custom to do this and sometimes he would go to the factory and sometimes he 
would not there was a car line which carried him rapidly cityward to a rendezvous 
and he would either ride or walk with her as the case might be there 
was constant thought on his and her part of the risk involved but still they 
persisted by some stroke of ill or good fortune norman wilson returned from chicago so 
that carlotta's movements had to be calculated to a nicety but she did not care 
she trusted most to the automobiles which she could hire at convenient garages and which 
would carry them rapidly away from the vicinity where they might be seen and recognized 
it was a tangled life difficult and dangerous there was no peace in it for 
there is neither peace nor happiness in deception a burning joy at one time was 
invariably followed by a disturbing remorse afterward there was carlotta's mother norman wilson and angela 
to guard against to say nothing of the constant pricking of his own conscience it 
is almost a foregone conclusion in any situation of this kind that it cannot endure 
the seed of its undoing is in itself we think that our actions when unseen 
of mortal eyes resolve themselves into nothingness but this is not true they are woven 
indefinably into our being and shine forth ultimately as the real self in spite of 
all our pretences one could almost accept the brahmanistic dogma of a psychic body which 
sees and is seen where we dream all to be darkness there is no other 
supposition on which to explain the facts of intuition so many individuals have it they 
know so well without knowing why they know angela had this intuitive power in connection 
with eugene because of her great affection for him she divined or apprehended many things 
in connection with him long before they occurred throughout her absence from him she had 
been haunted by the idea that she ought to be with him and now that 
she was here and the first excitement of contact and adjustment was over she was 
beginning to be aware of something eugene was not the same as he had been 
a little while before he had left her his attitude in spite of a kindly 
show of affection was distant and preoccupied he had no real power of concealing anything 
he appeared at timesat most times when he was with herto be lost in a 
mist of speculation he was lonely and a little lovesick because under the pressure of 
home affairs carlotta was not able to see him quite so much at the same 
time now that the fall was coming on he was growing weary of the shop 
at speonk for the gray days and slight chill which settled upon the earth at 
times caused the shop windows to be closed and robbed the yard of that air 
of romance which had characterized it when he first came there he could not take 
his way of an evening along the banks of the stream to the arms of 
carlotta the novelty of big john and joseph mews and malachi dempsey and little suddsy 
had worn off he was beginning now to see also that they were nothing but 
plain workingmen after all worrying over the fact that they were not getting more than 
fifteen or seventeen and a half cents an hour jealous of each other and their 
superiors full of all the frailties and weaknesses to which the flesh is heir his 
coming had created a slight diversion for them for he was very strange but his 
strangeness was no longer a novelty they were beginning to see him also as a 
relatively commonplace human being he was an artist to be sure but his actions and 
intentions were not so vastly different from those of other men a shop of this 
kind like any other institution where people are compelled by force of circumstances to work 
together whether the weather be fair or foul or the mood grave or gay can 
readily become and frequently does become a veritable hell human nature is a subtle irritable 
irrational thing it is not so much governed by rules of ethics and conditions of 
understanding as a thing of moods and temperament eugene could easily see philosopher that he 
was that these people would come here enveloped in some mist of home trouble or 
secret illness or grief and would conceive that somehow it was not their state of 
mind but the things around them which were the cause of all their woe sour 
looks would breed sour looks in return a gruff question would beget a gruff answer 
there were longstanding grudges between one man and another based on nothing more than a 
grouchy observation at one time in the past he thought by introducing gaiety and persistent 
if makebelieve geniality that he was tending to obviate and overcome the general condition but 
this was only relatively true his own gaiety was capable of becoming as much of 
a weariness to those who were out of the spirit of it as was the 
sour brutality with which at times he was compelled to contend so he wished that 
he might arrange to get well and get out of here or at least change 
his form of work for it was plain to be seen that this condition would 
not readily improve his presence was a commonplace his power to entertain and charm was 
practically gone this situation coupled with angela's spirit of honest conservatism was bad but it 
was destined to be much worse from watching him and endeavoring to decipher his moods 
angela came to suspect somethingshe could not say what he did not love her as 
much as he had there was a coolness in his caresses which was not there 
when he left her what could have happened she asked herself was it just absence 
or what one day when he had returned from an afternoon's outing with carlotta and 
was holding her in his arms in greeting she asked him solemnly: do you love 
me honeybun you know i do he asseverated but without any energy for he could 
not regain his old original feeling for her there was no trace of it only 
sympathy pity and a kind of sorrow that she was being so badly treated after 
all her efforts no you don't she replied detecting the hollow ring in what he 
said her voice was sad and her eyes showed traces of that wistful despair into 
which she could so readily sink at times why yes i do angelface he insisted 
what makes you ask what's come over you he was wondering whether she had heard 
anything or seen anything and was concealing her knowledge behind this preliminary inquiry nothing she 
replied only you don't love me i don't know what it is i don't know 
why but i can feel it right here and she laid her hand on her 
heart the action was sincere unstudied it hurt him for it was like that of 
a little child oh hush don't say that he pleaded you know i do don't 
look so gloomy i love youdon't you know i do and he kissed her no 
no said angela i know you don't oh dear oh dear i feel so bad 
eugene was dreading another display of the hysteria with which he was familiar but it 
did not come she conquered her mood inasmuch as she had no real basis for 
suspicion and went about the work of getting him his dinner she was depressed though 
and he was fearful what if she should ever find out more days passed carlotta 
called him up at the shop occasionally for there was no phone where he lived 
and she would not have risked it if there had been she sent him registered 
notes to be signed for addressed to henry kingsland and directed to the post office 
at speonk eugene was not known there as witla and easily secured these missives which 
were usually very guarded in their expressions and concerned appointmentsthe vaguest most mysterious directions which 
he understood they made arrangements largely from meeting to meeting saying if i can't keep 
it thursday at two it will be friday at the same time and if not 
then saturday if anything happens i'll send you a registered special so it went on 
one noontime eugene walked down to the little post office at speonk to look for 
a letter for carlotta had not been able to meet him the previous day and 
had phoned instead that she would write the following day he found it safely enough 
and after glancing at itit contained but few wordsdecided to tear it up as usual 
and throw the pieces away a mere expression ashes of roses which she sometimes used 
to designate herself and the superscription oh genie made it however inexpressibly dear to him 
he thought he would hold it in his possession just a little whilea few hours 
longer it was enigmatic enough to anyone but himself he thought even if found the 
bridge two wednesday the bridge referred to was one over the harlem at morris heights 
he kept the appointment that day as requested but by some necromancy of fate he 
forgot the letter until he was within his own door then he took it out 
tore it up into four or five pieces quickly put it in his vest pocket 
and went upstairs intending at the first opportunity to dispose of it meanwhile angela for 
the first time since they had been living at riverwood had decided to walk over 
toward the factory about six o'clock and meet eugene on his way home she heard 
him discourse on the loveliness of this stream and what a pleasure it was to 
stroll along its banks morning and evening he was so fond of the smooth water 
and the overhanging leaves she had walked with him there already on several sundays when 
she went this evening she thought what a pleasant surprise it would be for him 
for she had prepared everything on leaving so that his supper would not be delayed 
when they reached home she heard the whistle blow as she neared the shop and 
standing behind a clump of bushes on the thither side of the stream she waited 
expecting to pounce out on eugene with a loving boo he did not come the 
forty or fifty men who worked here trickled out like a little stream of black 
ants and then eugene not appearing angela went over to the gate which joseph mews 
in the official capacity of gateman after the whistle blew was closing is mr witla 
here asked angela peering through the bars at him eugene had described joseph so accurately 
to her that she recognized him at sight no ma'am replied joseph quite taken back 
by this attractive arrival for goodlooking women were not common at the shop gate of 
the factory he left four or five hours ago i think he left at one 
o'clock if i remember right he wasn't working with us today he was working out 
in the yard you don't know where he went do you asked angela who was 
surprised at this novel information eugene had not said anything about going anywhere where could 
he have gone no'm i don't replied joseph volubly he sometimes goes off this wayquite 
frequent ma'am his wife calls him upernow maybe you're his wife i am said angela 
but she was no longer thinking of what she was saying her words on the 
instant were becoming mechanical eugene going away frequently he had never said anything to her 
his wife calling him up could there be another woman instantly all her old suspicions 
jealousies fears awoke and she was wondering why she had not fixed on this fact 
before that explained eugene's indifference of course that explained his air of abstraction he wasn't 
thinking of her the miserable creature he was thinking of someone else still she could 
not be sure for she had no proof two adroit questions elicited the fact that 
no one in the shop had ever seen his wife he had just gone out 
a woman had called up angela took her way home amid a whirling fire of 
conjecture when she reached it eugene was not there yet for he sometimes delayed his 
coming lingering as he said to look at the water it was natural enough in 
an artist she went upstairs and hung the broadbrimmed straw she had worn in the 
closet and went into the kitchen to await his coming experience with him and the 
nature of her own temperament determined her to enact a rôle of subtlety she would 
wait until he spoke pretending that she had not been out she would ask whether 
he had had a hard day and see whether he disclosed the fact that he 
had been away from the factory that would show her positively what he was doing 
and whether he was deliberately deceiving her eugene came up the stairs gay enough but 
anxious to deposit the scraps of paper where they would not be seen no opportunity 
came for angela was there to greet him did you have a hard job today 
she asked noting that he made no preliminary announcement of any absence not very he 
replied no i don't look tired no she said bitterly but concealing her feelings she 
wanted to see how thoroughly and deliberately he would lie but i thought maybe you 
might have did you stop to look at the water tonight yes he replied smoothly 
it's very lovely over there i never get tired of it the sun on the 
leaves these days now that they are turning yellow is so beautiful they look a 
little like stained glass at certain angles her first impulse after hearing this was to 
exclaim why do you lie to me eugene for her temper was fiery almost uncontrollable 
at times but she restrained herself she wanted to find out morehow she did not 
know but time if she could only wait a little would help her eugene went 
to the bath congratulating himself on the ease of his escapethe comfortable fact that he 
was not catechised very much but in this temporary feeling of satisfaction he forgot the 
scraps of paper in his vest pocketthough not for long he hung his coat and 
vest on a hook and started into the bedroom to get himself a fresh collar 
and tie while he was in there angela passed the bathroom door she was always 
interested in eugene's clothes how they were wearing but tonight there were other thoughts in 
her mind hastily and by intuition she went through his pockets finding the torn scraps 
then for excuse took his coat and vest down to clean certain spots at the 
same moment eugene thought of his letter he came hurrying out to get it or 
the pieces rather but angela already had them and was looking at them curiously what 
was that she asked all her suspicious nature on the qui vive for additional proof 
why should he keep the torn fragments of a letter in his pocket for days 
she had had a psychic sense of something impending everything about him seemed strangely to 
call for investigation now it was all coming out nothing he said nervously a memorandum 
throw it in the paper box angela noted the peculiarity of his voice and manner 
she was taken by the guilty expression of his eyes something was wrong it concerned 
these scraps of paper maybe it was in these she would be able to read 
the riddle of his conduct the woman's name might be in here like a flash 
it came to her that she might piece these scraps together but there was another 
thought equally swift which urged her to pretend indifference that might help her pretend now 
and she would know more later she threw them in the paper box thinking to 
piece them together at her leisure eugene noted her hesitation her suspicion he was afraid 
she would do something what he could not guess he breathed more easily when the 
papers fluttered into the practically empty box but he was nervous if they were only 
burned he did not think she would attempt to put them together but he was 
afraid he would have given anything if his sense of romance had not led him 
into this trap chapter xxvii angela was quick to act upon her thought no sooner 
had eugene entered the bath than she gathered up the pieces threw other bits of 
paper like them in their place and tried quickly to piece them together on the 
ironing board where she was it was not difficult the scraps were not small on 
one triangular bit were the words oh genie with a colon after it on another 
the words the bridge and on another roses there was no doubt in her mind 
from this preliminary survey that this was a love note and every nerve in her 
body tingled to the terrible import of it could it really be true could eugene 
have found someone else was this the cause of his coolness and his hypocritical pretence 
of affection and of his not wanting her to come to him oh god would 
her sufferings never cease she hurried into the front room her face white her hand 
clenching the telltale bits and there set to work to complete her task it did 
not take her long in four minutes it was all together and then she saw 
it all a love note from some demon of a woman no doubt of it 
some mysterious woman in the background ashes of roses now god curse her for a 
siren a love thief a hypnotizing snake fascinating men with her evil eyes and eugene 
the dog the scoundrel the vile coward the traitor was there no decency no morality 
no kindness no gratitude in his soul after all her patience all her suffering all 
her loneliness her poverty to treat her like this writing that he was sick and 
lonely and unable to have her with him and at the same time running around 
with a strange woman ashes of roses oh curses curses curses on her harlot's heart 
and brain might god strike her dead for her cynical brutal seizing upon that sacred 
possession which belonged to another she wrung her hands desperately angela was fairly beside herself 
through her dainty little head ran a foaming torrent of rage hate envy sorrow selfcommiseration 
brutal desire for revenge if she could only get at this woman if she could 
only denounce eugene now to his face if she could only find them together and 
kill them how she would like to strike her on the mouth how tear her 
hair and her eyes out something of the forest cat's cruel rage shone in her 
gleaming eyes as she thought of her for if she could have had carlotta there 
alone she would have tortured her with hot irons torn her tongue and teeth from 
their roots beaten her into insensibility and an unrecognizable mass she was a real tigress 
now her eyes gleaming her red lips wet she would kill her kill her kill 
her as god was judge she would kill her if she could find her and 
eugene and herself yes yes she would better death than this agony of suffering better 
a thousand times to be dead with this beast of a woman dead beside her 
and eugene than to suffer this way she didn't deserve it why did god torture 
her so why was she made to bleed at every step by this her sacrificial 
love had she not been a good wife had she not laid every tribute of 
tenderness patience selfabnegation selfsacrifice and virtue on the altar of love what more could god 
ask what more could man want had she not waited on eugene in sickness and 
health she had gone without clothes gone without friends hidden herself away in blackwood the 
seven months while he was here frittering away his health and time in love and 
immorality and what was her reward in chicago in tennessee in mississippi had she not 
waited on him sat up with him of nights walked the floor with him when 
he was nervous consoled him in his fear of poverty and failure and here she 
was now after seven long months of patient waiting and watchingeating her lonely heart outforsaken 
oh the inconceivable inhumanity of the human heart to think anybody could be so vile 
so low so unkind so cruel to think that eugene with his black eyes his 
soft hair his smiling face could be so treacherous so subtle so dastardly could he 
really be as mean as this note proved him to be could he be as 
brutal as selfish was she awake or asleep was this a dream ah god no 
no it was not a dream it was a cold bitter agonizing reality and the 
cause of all her suffering was there in the bathroom now shaving himself for one 
moment she thought she would go in and strike him where he stood she thought 
she could tear his heart out cut him up but then suddenly the picture of 
him bleeding and dead came to her and she recoiled no no she could not 
do that oh no not eugeneand yet and yet oh god let me get my 
hands on that woman she said to herself let me get my hands on her 
i'll kill her i'll kill her i'll kill her this torrent of fury and selfpity 
was still raging in her heart when the bathroom knob clicked and eugene came out 
he was in his undershirt trousers and shoes looking for a clean white shirt he 
was very nervous over the note which had been thrown in scraps into the box 
but looking in the kitchen and seeing the pieces still there he was slightly reassured 
angela was not there he could come back and get them when he found out 
where she was he went on into the bedroom looking into the front room as 
he did so she appeared to be at the window waiting for him after all 
she was probably not as suspicious as he thought it was his own imagination he 
was too nervous and sensitive well he would get those pieces now if he could 
and throw them out of the window angela should not have a chance to examine 
them if she wanted to he slipped out into the kitchen made a quick grab 
for the little heap and sent the pieces flying then he felt much better he 
would never bring another letter home from anybody that was a certainty fate was too 
much against him angela came out after a bit for the click of the bathroom 
knob had sobered her a little her rage was high her pulse abnormal her whole 
being shaken to its roots but still she realized that she must have time to 
think she must see who this woman was first she must have time to find 
her eugene mustn't know where was she now where was this bridge where did they 
meet where did she live she wondered for the moment why she couldn't think it 
all out why it didn't come to her in a flash a revelation if she 
could only know in a few minutes eugene came in cleanshaven smiling his equanimity and 
peace of mind fairly well restored the letter was gone angela could never know she 
might suspect but this possible burst of jealousy had been nipped in the bud he 
came over toward her to put his arm round her but she slipped away from 
him pretending to need the sugar he let this effort at love making gothe will 
for the deed and sat down at the snowwhite little table set with tempting dishes 
and waited to be served the day had been very pleasant being early in october 
and he was pleased to see a last lingering ray of light falling on some 
red and yellow leaves this yard was very beautiful this little flat for all their 
poverty very charming angela was neat and trim in a dainty house dress of mingled 
brown and green a dark blue studio apron shielded her bosom and skirt she was 
very pale and distraughtlooking but eugene for the time was almost unconscious of ithe was 
so relieved are you very tired angela he finally asked sympathetically yes i'm not feeling 
so well today she replied what have you been doing ironing oh yes and cleaning 
i worked on the cupboard you oughtn't to try to do so much he said 
cheerfully you're not strong enough you think you're a little horse but you are only 
a colt better go slow hadn't you i will after i get everything straightened out 
to suit me she replied she was having the struggle of her life to conceal 
her real feelings never at any time had she undergone such an ordeal as this 
once in the studio when she discovered those two letters she thought she was sufferingbut 
that what was that to this what were her suspicions concerning frieda what were the 
lonely longings at home her grieving and worrying over his illness nothing nothing now he 
was actually faithless to her now she had the evidence this woman was here she 
was somewhere in the immediate background after these years of marriage and close companionship he 
was deceiving her it was possible that he had been with this woman today yesterday 
the day before the letter was not dated could it be that she was related 
to mrs hibberdell eugene had said that there was a married daughter but never that 
she was there if she was there why should he have moved he wouldn't have 
was it the wife of the man he was last living with no she was 
too homely angela had seen her eugene would never associate with her if she could 
only know ashes of roses the world went red before her eyes there was no 
use bursting into a storm now though if she could only be calm it would 
be better if she only had someone to talk toif there were a minister or 
a bosom friend she might go to a detective agency they might help her a 
detective could trace this woman and eugene did she want to do this it cost 
money they were very poor now paugh why should she worry about their poverty mending 
her dresses going without hats going without decent shoes and he wasting his time and 
being upon some shameless strumpet if he had money he would spend it on her 
still he had handed her almost all the money he had brought east with him 
intact how was that all the time eugene was sitting opposite her eating with fair 
heartiness if the trouble about the letter had not come out so favorably he would 
have been without appetite but now he felt at ease angela said she was not 
hungry and could not eat she passed him the bread the butter the hashed brown 
potatoes the tea and he ate cheerfully i think i am going to try and 
get out of that shop over there he volunteered affably why asked angela mechanically i'm 
tired of it the men are not so interesting to me now i'm tired of 
them i think mr haverford will transfer me if i write to him he said 
he would i'd rather be outside with some section gang if i could it's going 
to be very dreary in the shop when they close it up well if you're 
tired you'd better replied angela your mind needs diversion i know that why don't you 
write to mr haverford i will he said but he did not immediately he went 
into the front room and lit the gas eventually reading a paper then a book 
then yawning wearily angela came in after a time and sat down pale and tired 
she went and secured a little workbasket in which were socks undarned and other odds 
and ends and began on those but she revolted at the thought of doing anything 
for him and put them up she got out a skirt of hers which she 
was making eugene watched her a little while lazily his artistic eye measuring the various 
dimensions of her features she had a wellbalanced face he finally concluded he noted the 
effect of the light on her hairthe peculiar hue it gave itand wondered if he 
could get that in oil night scenes were harder than those of full daylight shadows 
were so very treacherous he got up finally well i'm going to turn in he 
said i'm tired i have to get up at six oh dear this darn day 
labor business gives me a pain i wish it were over angela did not trust 
herself to speak she was so full of pain and despair that she thought if 
she spoke she would cry he went out saying: coming soon she nodded her head 
when he was gone the storm burst and she broke into a blinding flood of 
tears they were not only tears of sorrow but of rage and helplessness she went 
out on a little balcony which was there and cried alone the night lights shining 
wistfully about after the first storm she began to harden and dry up again for 
helpless tears were foreign to her in a rage she dried her eyes and became 
whitefaced and desperate as before the dog the scoundrel the brute the hound she thought 
how could she ever have loved him how could she love him now oh the 
horror of life its injustice its cruelty its shame that she should be dragged through 
the mire with a man like this the pity of it the shame if this 
was art death take it and yet hate him as she mighthate this hellish mantrap 
who signed herself ashes of rosesshe loved him too she could not help it she 
knew she loved him oh to be crossed by two fevers like this why might 
she not die why not die right now chapter xxviii the hells of love are 
bitter and complete there were days after that when she watched him followed him down 
the pleasant lane from the house to the water's edge slipping out unceremoniously after he 
had gone not more than eight hundred feet she watched the bridge at riverwood at 
one and six expecting that eugene and his paramour might meet there it just happened 
that carlotta was compelled to leave town for ten days with her husband and so 
eugene was safe on two occasions he went downtowninto the heart of the great city 
anxious to get a breath of the old life that so fascinated him and angela 
followed him only to lose track of him quickly he did nothing evil however merely 
walked wondering what miriam finch and christina channing and norma whitmore were doing these days 
and what they were thinking of him in his long absence of all the people 
he had known he had only seen norma whitmore once and that was not long 
after he returned to new york he had given her a garbled explanation of his 
illness stated that he was going to work now and proposed to come and see 
her he did his best to avoid observation however for he dreaded explaining the reason 
of his nonproductive condition miriam finch was almost glad that he had failed since he 
had treated her so badly christina channing was in opera as he quickly discovered for 
he saw her name blazoned one day the following november in the newspapers she was 
a star of whose talent great hopes were entertained and was interested almost exclusively in 
her career she was to sing in bohème and rigoletto another thing fortunate for eugene 
at this time was that he changed his work there came to the shop one 
day an irish foreman timothy deegan master of a score of guineas as he called 
the italian day laborers who worked for him who took eugene's fancy greatly he was 
of medium height thick of body and neck with a cheerful healthy red face a 
keen twinkling gray eye and stiff closely cropped gray hair and mustache he had come 
to lay the foundation for a small dynamo in the engine room at speonk which 
was to supply the plant with light in case of night work and a car 
of his had been backed in a tool car full of boards barrows mortar boards 
picks and shovels eugene was amused and astonished at his insistent defiant attitude and the 
brisk manner in which he was handing out orders to his men come matt come 
jimmie get the shovels now get the picks he heard him shout bring some sand 
here bring some stone where's the cement now where's the cement jasus christ i must 
have some cement what arre ye all doing hurry now hurry bring the cement well 
he knows how to give orders commented eugene to big john who was standing near 
he certainly does replied the latter to himself eugene observed hearing only the calls at 
first the irish brute later he discovered a subtle twinkle in deegan's eyes as he 
stood brazenly in the door looking defiantly about there was no brutality in it only 
selfconfidence and a hearty irish insistence on the necessity of the hour well you're a 
dandy commented eugene boldly after a time and laughed ha ha ha mocked deegan in 
return if you had to work as harred as these men you wouldn't laugh i'm 
not laughing at them i'm laughing at you explained eugene laugh said deegan shure you're 
as funny to me as i am to you eugene laughed again the irishman agreed 
with himself that there was humor in it he laughed too eugene patted his big 
rough shoulder with his hands and they were friends immediately it did not take deegan 
long to find out from big john why he was there and what he was 
doing an arrtist he commented shewer he'd better be outside than in the loikes of 
him packin' shavin's and him laughin' at me big john smiled i believe he wants 
to get outside he said why don't he come with me then he'd have a 
foine time workin' with the guineas shewer 'twould make a man av hima few months 
of thatand he pointed to angelo esposito shoveling clay big john thought this worth reporting 
to eugene he did not think that he wanted to work with the guineas but 
he might like to be with deegan eugene saw his opportunity he liked deegan would 
you like to have an artist who's looking for health come and work for you 
deegan eugene asked genially he thought deegan might refuse but it didn't matter it was 
worth the trial shewer replied the latter will i have to work with the italians 
there'll be plenty av work for ye to do without ever layin' yer hand to 
pick or shovel unless ye want to shewer that's no work fer a white man 
to do and what do you call them deegan aren't they white shewer they're naat 
what are they then they're not black nagurs of coorse but they're not negroes will 
begad they're naat white any man kin tell that be lookin' at thim eugene smiled 
he understood at once the solid irish temperament which could draw this hearty conclusion there 
was no malice in it deegan did not underestimate these italians he liked his men 
but they weren't white he didn't know what they were exactly but they weren't white 
he was standing over them a moment later shouting up with it up with it 
down with it down with it as though his whole soul were intent on driving 
the last scrap of strength out of these poor underlings when as a matter of 
fact they were not working very hard at all his glance was roving about in 
a general way as he yelled and they paid little attention to him once in 
a while he would interpolate a come matt in a softer keya key so soft 
that it was entirely out of keeping with his other voice eugene saw it all 
clearly he understood deegan i think i'll get mr haverford to transfer me to you 
if you'll let me come he said at the close of the day when deegan 
was taking off his overalls and the eyetalians as he called them were putting the 
things back in the car shewer said deegan impressed by the great name of haverford 
if eugene could accomplish that through such a faroff wondrous personality he must be a 
remarkable man himself come along i'll be glad to have ye ye can just make 
out the o k blanks and the repoarts and watch over the min sich times 
as i'll naat be there andwellall told ye'll have enough to keep ye busy eugene 
smiled this was a pleasant prospect big john had told him during the morning that 
deegan went up and down the road from peekskill on the main line chatham on 
the midland division and mt kisco on a third branch to new york city he 
built wells culverts coal bins building pierssmall brick buildingsanything and everything in short which a 
capable foremanmason ought to be able to build and in addition he was fairly content 
and happy in his task eugene could see it the atmosphere of the man was 
wholesome he was like a tonica revivifying dynamo to this sickly overwrought sentimentalist that night 
he went home to angela full of the humor and romance of his new situation 
he liked the idea of it he wanted to tell her about deeganto make her 
laugh he was destined unfortunately to another kind of reception for angela by this time 
had endured the agony of her discovery to the breaking point she had listened to 
his pretences knowing them to be lies until she could endure it no longer in 
following him she had discovered nothing and the change in his work would make the 
chase more difficult it was scarcely possible for anyone to follow him for he himself 
did not know where he would be from day to day he would be here 
there and everywhere his sense of security as well as of his unfairness made him 
sensitive about being nice in the unimportant things when he thought at all he was 
ashamed of what he was doingthoroughly ashamed like the drunkard he appeared to be mastered 
by his weakness and the psychology of his attitude is so best interpreted he caressed 
her sympathetically for he thought from her drawn weary look that she was verging on 
some illness she appeared to him to be suffering from worry for him overwork or 
approaching malady but eugene in spite of his unfaithfulness did sympathize with angela greatly he 
appreciated her good qualitiesher truthfulness economy devotion and selfsacrifice in all things which related to 
him he was sorry that his own yearning for freedom crossed with her desire for 
simpleminded devotion on his part he could not love her as she wanted him to 
that he knew and yet he was at times sorry for it very he would 
look at her when she was not looking at him admiring her industry her patience 
her pretty figure her geniality in the face of many difficulties and wish that she 
could have had a better fate than to have met and married him because of 
these feelings on his part for her he could not bear to see her suffer 
when she appeared to be ill he could not help drawing near to her wanting 
to know how she was endeavoring to make her feel better by those sympathetic emotional 
demonstrations which he knew meant so much to her on this particular evening noting the 
still drawn agony of her face he was moved to insist what's the matter with 
you angelface these days you look so tired you're not right what's troubling you oh 
nothing replied angela wearily but i know there is he replied you can't be feeling 
well what's ailing you you're not like yourself at all won't you tell me sweet 
what's the trouble he was thinking because angela said nothing that it must be a 
real physical illness any emotional complaint vented itself quickly why should you care she asked 
cautiously breaking her selfimposed vow of silence she was thinking that eugene and this woman 
whoever she was were conspiring to defeat her and that they were succeeding her voice 
had changed from one of weary resignation to subtle semiconcealed complaint and offense and eugene 
noted it before she could add any more he had observed why shouldn't i why 
how you talk what's the matter now angela really did not intend to go on 
her query was dragged out of her by his obvious sympathy he was sorry for 
her in some general way it made her pain and wrath all the greater and 
his additional inquiry irritated her the more why should you she asked weepingly you don't 
want me you don't like me you pretend sympathy when i look a little bad 
but that's all but you don't care for me if you could get rid of 
me you would that is so plain why what are you talking about he asked 
astonished had she found out anything was the incident of the scraps of paper really 
closed had anybody been telling her anything about carlotta instantly he was all at sea 
still he had to pretend you know i care he said how can you say 
that you don't you know you don't she flared up suddenly why do you lie 
you don't care don't touch me don't come near me i'm sick of your hypocritical 
pretences oh and she straightened up with her finger nails cutting into her palms eugene 
at the first expression of disbelief on her part had laid his hand soothingly on 
her arm that was why she had jumped away from him now he drew back 
nonplussed nervous a little defiant it was easier to combat rage than sorrow but he 
did not want to do either what's the matter with you he asked assuming a 
look of bewildered innocence what have i done now what haven't you done you'd better 
ask you dog you coward flared angela leaving me to stay out in wisconsin while 
you go running around with a shameless woman don't deny it don't dare to deny 
itthis apropos of a protesting movement on the part of eugene's headi know all i 
know more than i want to know i know how you've been acting i know 
what you've been doing i know how you've been lying to me you've been running 
around with a low vile wretch of a woman while i have been staying out 
in blackwood eating my heart out that's what you've been doing dear angela dear angelface 
dear madonna doloroso ha what have you been calling her you lying hypocritical coward what 
names have you for her hypocrite brute liar i know what you've been doing oh 
how well i know why was i ever bornoh why why her voice trailed off 
in a wail of agony eugene stood there astonished to the point of inefficiency he 
could not think of a single thing to do or say he had no idea 
upon what evidence she based her complaint he fancied that it must be much more 
than had been contained in that little note which he had torn up she had 
not seen thatof that he was reasonably sureor was he could she have taken it 
out of the box while he was in the bath and then put it back 
again this sounded like it she had looked very bad that night how much did 
she know where had she secured this information mrs hibberdell carlotta no had she seen 
her where when you're talking through your hat he said aimlessly and largely in order 
to get time you're crazy what's got into you anyhow i haven't been doing anything 
of the sort oh haven't you she sneered you haven't been meeting her at bridges 
and road houses and street cars have you you liar you haven't been calling her 
'ashes of roses' and 'river nymph' and 'angel girl' angela was making up names and 
places out of her own mind i suppose you used some of the pet names 
on her that you gave to christina channing didn't you she'd like those the vile 
strumpet and you you dog pretending to mepretending sympathy pretending loneliness pretending sorrow that i 
couldn't be here a lot you cared what i was doing or thinking or suffering 
oh i hate you you horrible coward i hate her i hope something terrible happens 
to you if i could get at her now i would kill her and you 
bothand myself i would i wish i could die i wish i could die eugene 
was beginning to get the measure of his iniquity as angela interpreted it he could 
see now how cruelly he had hurt her he could see now how vile what 
he was doing looked in her eyes it was bad businessrunning with other womenno doubt 
of it it always ended in something like thisa terrible storm in which he had 
to sit by and hear himself called brutal names to which there was no legitimate 
answer he had heard of this in connection with other people but he had never 
thought it would come to him and the worst of it was that he was 
guilty and deserving of it no doubt of that it lowered him in his own 
estimation it lowered her in his and her own because she had to fight this 
way why did he do it why did he drag her into such a situation 
it was breaking down that sense of pride in himself which was the only sustaining 
power a man had before the gaze of the world why did he let himself 
into these situations did he really love carlotta did he want pleasure enough to endure 
such abuse as this this was a terrible scene and where would it end his 
nerves were tingling his brain fairly aching if he could only conquer this desire for 
another type and be faithful and yet how dreadful that seemed to confine himself in 
all his thoughts to just angela it was not possible he thought of these things 
standing there enduring the brunt of this storm it was a terrible ordeal but it 
was not wholly reformatory even at that what's the use of your carrying on like 
that angela he said grimly after he had listened to all this it isn't as 
bad as you think i'm not a liar and i'm not a dog you must 
have pieced that note i threw in the paper box together and read it when 
did you do it he was curious about that and about how much she knew 
what were her intentions in regard to him what in regard to carlotta what would 
she do next when did i do it she replied when did i do it 
what has that to do with it what right have you to ask where is 
this woman that's what i want to know i want to find her i want 
to face her i want to tell her what a wretched beast she is i'll 
show her how to come and steal another woman's husband i'll kill her i'll kill 
her and i'll kill you too do you hear i'll kill you and she advanced 
on him defiantly blazingly eugene was astounded he had never seen such rage in any 
woman it was wonderful fascinating something like a great lightningriven storm angela was capable of 
hurling thunderbolts of wrath he had not known that it raised her in his estimationmade 
her really more attractive than she would otherwise have been for power however displayed is 
fascinating she was so little so grim so determined it was in its way a 
test of great capability and he liked her for it even though he resented her 
abuse no no angela he said sympathetically and with a keen wish to alleviate her 
sorrow you would not do anything like that you couldn't i will i will she 
declared i'll kill her and you too and then having reached this tremendous height she 
suddenly broke eugene's big sympathetic understanding was after all too much for her his brooding 
patience in the midst of her wrath his innate sorrow for what he could not 
or would not help it was written all over his face his very obvious presentation 
of the fact by his attitude that he knew that she loved him in spite 
of this was too much for her it was like beating her hands against a 
stone she might kill him and this woman whoever she was but she would not 
have changed his attitude toward her and that was what she wanted a great torrent 
of heartbreaking sobs broke from her shaking her frame like a reed she threw her 
arms and head upon the kitchen table falling to her knees and cried and cried 
eugene stood there contemplating the wreck he had made of her dreams certainly it was 
hell he said to himself certainly it was he was a liar as she said 
a dog a scoundrel poor little angela well the damage had been done what could 
he do now anything certainly not not a thing she was brokenheartbroken there was no 
earthly remedy for that priests might shrive for broken laws but for a broken heart 
what remedy was there angela he called gently angela i'm sorry don't cry angela don't 
cry but she did not hear him she did not hear anything lost in the 
agony of her situation she could only sob convulsively until it seemed that her pretty 
little frame would break to pieces chapter xxix eugene's feelings on this occasion were of 
reasonable duration it is always possible under such circumstances to take the victim of our 
brutalities in our arms and utter a few sympathetic or repentant words the real kindness 
and repentance which consists in reformation is quite another matter one must see with eyes 
too pure to behold evil to do that eugene was not to be reformed by 
an hour or many hours of agony on anyone's part angela was well within the 
range of his sympathetic interests he suffered with her keenly but not enough to outrun 
or offset his own keen desire for what he considered his spiritual right to enjoy 
beauty what harm did it do he would have asked himself if he secretly exchanged 
affectionate looks and feelings with carlotta or any other woman who fascinated him and in 
turn was fascinated by him could an affinity of this character really be called evil 
he was not giving her any money which angela ought to have or very little 
he did not want to marry herand she really did not want to marry him 
he thoughtthere was no chance of that anyhow he wanted to associate with her and 
what harm did that do angela none if she did not know of course if 
she knew it was very sad for her and for him but if the shoe 
were on the other foot and angela was the one who was acting as he 
was acting now he would not care he thought he forgot to add that if 
he did not care it would be because he was not in love and angela 
was in love such reasoning runs in circles only it is not reasoning it is 
sentimental and emotional anarchy there is no will toward progress in it when angela recovered 
from her first burst of rage and grief it was only to continue it further 
though not in quite the same vein there can only be one superlative in any 
field of endeavor beyond that may be mutterings and thunderings or a shining afterglow but 
no second superlative angela charged him with every weakness and evil tendency only to have 
him look at her in a solemn way occasionally saying: oh no you know i'm 
not as bad as that or why do you abuse me in that way that 
isn't true or why do you say that because it is so and you know 
it's so angela would declare listen angela he replied once with a certain amount of 
logic there is no use in browbeating me in this way it doesn't do any 
good to call me names you want me to love you don't you that's all 
that you want you don't want anything else will calling me names make me do 
it if i can't i can't and if i can i can how will fighting 
help that she listened to him pitifully for she knew that her rage was useless 
or practically so he was in the position of power she loved him that was 
the sad part of it to think that tears and pleadings and wrath might not 
really avail after all he could only love her out of a desire that was 
not selfgenerated that was something she was beginning to see in a dim way as 
a grim truth once she folded her hands and sat white and drawn staring at 
the floor well i don't know what to do she declared i suppose i ought 
to leave you if it just weren't for my family they all think so highly 
of the marriage state they are so naturally faithful and decent i suppose these qualities 
have to be born in people they can't be acquired you would have to be 
made over eugene knew she would not leave him he smiled at the superior condescension 
of the last remark though it was not intended as such by her to think 
of his being made over after the model angela and her relatives would lay down 
i don't know where i'd go or what i'd do she observed i can't go 
back to my family i don't want to go there i haven't been trained in 
anything except school teaching and i hate to think of that again if i could 
only study stenography or bookkeeping she was talking as much to clear her own mind 
as his she really did not know what to do eugene listened to this selfdemonstrated 
situation with a shamed face it was hard for him to think of angela being 
thrown out on the world as a bookkeeper or a stenographer he did not want 
to see her doing anything like that in a way he wanted to live with 
her if it could be done in his waymuch as the mormons might perhaps what 
a lonely life hers would be if she were away from him and she was 
not suited to it she was not suited to the commercial worldshe was too homey 
too housewifely he wished he could assure her now that she would not have further 
cause for grief and mean it but he was like a sick man wishing he 
could do the things a hale man might there was no selfconviction in his thoughts 
only the idea that if he tried to do right in this matter he might 
succeed but he would be unhappy so he drifted in the meanwhile eugene had taken 
up his work with deegan and was going through a very curious experience at the 
time deegan had stated that he would take him he had written to haverford making 
a polite request for transfer and was immediately informed that his wishes would be granted 
haverford remembered eugene kindly he hoped he was improving he understood from inquiry of the 
superintendent of buildings that deegan was in need of a capable assistant anyhow and that 
eugene could well serve in that capacity the foreman was always in trouble about his 
reports an order was issued to deegan commanding him to receive eugene and another to 
eugene from the office of the superintendent of buildings ordering him to report to deegan 
eugene went finding him working on the problem of constructing a coal bin under the 
depot at fords centre and raising as much storm as ever he was received with 
a grin of satisfaction so here ye arre will ye're just in time i want 
ye to go down to the ahffice eugene laughed sure he said deegan was down 
in a freshly excavated hole and his clothes were redolent of the freshly turned earth 
which surrounded him he had a plumb bob in his hand and a spirit level 
but he laid them down under the neat train shed to which he crawled when 
eugene appeared and where they stood he fished from a pocket of his old gray 
coat a soiled and crumpled letter which he carefully unfolded with his thick and clumsy 
fingers then he held it up and looked at it defiantly i want ye to 
go to woodlawn he continued and look after some bolts that arre theyerthere's a keg 
av thiman' sign the bill fer thim an' ship thim down to me they're not 
miny an' thin i waant ye to go down to the ahffice an' take thim 
this o k and here he fished around and produced another crumpled slip it's nonsinse 
he exclaimed when he saw it it's onraisonable they're aalways yillen fer thim o k 
blanks ye'd think begad i was goin' to steal thim from thim ye'd think i 
lived on thim things o k blanks o k blanks from mornin' 'til night o 
k blanks it's nonsinse it's onraisonable and his face flushed a defiant red eugene could 
see that some infraction of the railroad's rules had occurred and that deegan had been 
called down or jacked up about it as the railroad men expressed it he was 
in a high state of dudgeonas defiant and pugnacious as his royal irish temper would 
allow i'll fix it said eugene that's all right leave it to me deegan showed 
some signs of approaching relief at last he had a man of intilligence as he 
would have expressed it he flung a parting shot though at his superior as eugene 
departed tell thim i'll sign fer thim when i git thim and naat before he 
rumbled eugene laughed he knew no such message would be accepted but he was glad 
to give deegan an opportunity to blow off steam he entered upon his new tasks 
with vim pleased with the outofdoors the sunshine the opportunity for brief trips up and 
down the road like this it was delightful he would soon be all right now 
that he knew he went to woodlawn and signed for the bolts went to the 
office and met the chief clerk delivering the desired o k blanks in person who 
informed him of the chief difficulty in deegan's life it appeared that there were some 
twentyfive of these reports to be made out monthly to say nothing of endless o 
k blanks to be filled in with acknowledgments of material received everything had to be 
signed for in this way it mattered not whether it was a section of a 
bridge or a single bolt or a pound of putty if a man could sit 
down and reel off a graphic report of what he was doing he was the 
pride of the chief clerk's heart his doing the work properly was taken as a 
matter of course deegan was not efficient at this though he was assisted at times 
by his wife and all three of his children a boy and two girls he 
was constantly in hot water my god exclaimed the chief clerk when eugene explained that 
deegan had thought that he might leave the bolts at the station where they would 
be safe until he needed them and then sign for them when he took them 
out he ran his hands distractedly through his hair what do you think of that 
he exclaimed he'll leave them there until he needs them will he what becomes of 
my reports i've got to have those o k's you tell deegan he ought to 
know better than that he's been long enough on the road you tell him that 
i said that i want a signed form for everything consigned to him the moment 
he learns that it's waiting for him and i want it without fail let him 
go and get it the gall he's got to come to time about this or 
something's going to drop i'm not going to stand it any longer you'd better help 
him in this i've got to make out my reports on time eugene agreed that 
he would this was his field he could help deegan he could be really useful 
time passed the weather grew colder and while the work was interesting at first like 
all other things it began after a time to grow monotonous it was nice enough 
when the weather was fine to stand out under the trees where some culvert was 
being built to bridge a small rivulet or some well to supply the freight engines 
with water and survey the surrounding landscape but when the weather grew colder it was 
not so nice deegan was always interesting he was forever raising a ruction he lived 
a life of hard narrow activity laid among boards wheelbarrows cement stone a life which 
concerned construction and had no particular joy in fruition the moment a thing was nicely 
finished they had to leave it and go where everything would be torn up again 
eugene used to look at the wounded ground the piles of yellow mud the dirty 
italians clean enough in their spirit but soiled and gnarled by their labor and wonder 
how much longer he could stand it to think that he of all men should 
be here working with deegan and the guineas he became lonesome at timesterribly and sad 
he longed for carlotta longed for a beautiful studio longed for a luxurious artistic life 
it seemed that life had wronged him terribly and yet he could do nothing about 
it he had no moneymaking capacity about this time the construction of a rather pretentious 
machine shop two hundred by two hundred feet and four storeys high was assigned to 
deegan largely because of the efficiency which eugene contributed to deegan's work eugene handled his 
reports and accounts with rapidity and precision and this so soothed the division management that 
they had an opportunity to see deegan's real worth the latter was beside himself with 
excitement anticipating great credit and distinction for the work he was now to be permitted 
to do 'tis the foine time we'll have eugene me bye he exclaimed puttin' up 
that buildin' 'tis no culvert we'll be afther buildin' now nor no coal bin wait 
till the masons come then ye'll see somethin' eugene was pleased that their work was 
progressing so successfully but of course there was no future in it for him he 
was lonely and disheartened besides angela was complaining and rightfully enough that they were leading 
a difficult lifeand to what end so far as she was concerned he might recover 
his health and his art by reason of his dramatic shakeup and changes he appeared 
to be doing so but what would that avail her he did not love her 
if he became prosperous again it might be to forsake her and at best he 
could only give her money and position if he ever attained these and how would 
that help it was love that she wantedhis love and she did not have that 
or only a mere shadow of it he had made up his mind after this 
last fatal argument that he would not pretend to anything he did not feel in 
regard to her and this made it even harder she did believe that he sympathized 
with her in his way but it was an intellectual sympathy and had very little 
to do with the heart he was sorry for her sorry sorry how she hated 
the thought of that if he could not do any better than that what was 
there in all the years to come but misery a curious fact to be noted 
about this period was that suspicion had so keyed up angela's perceptions that she could 
almost tell and that without knowing when eugene was with carlotta or had been there 
was something about his manner when he came in of an evening to say nothing 
of those subtler thought waves which passed from him to her when he was with 
carlotta which told her instantly where he had been and what he had been doing 
she would ask him where he had been and he would say: oh up to 
white plains or out to scarborough but nearly always when he had been with carlotta 
she would flare up with yes i know where you've been you've been out again 
with that miserable beast of a woman oh god will punish her yet you will 
be punished wait and see tears would flood her eyes and she would berate him 
roundly eugene stood in profound awe before these subtle outbreaks he could not understand how 
it was that angela came to know or suspect so accurately to a certain extent 
he was a believer in spiritualism and the mysteries of a subconscious mind or self 
he fancied that there must be some way of this subconscious self seeing or apprehending 
what was going on and of communicating its knowledge in the form of fear and 
suspicion to angela's mind if the very subtleties of nature were in league against him 
how was he to continue or profit in this career obviously it could not be 
done he would probably be severely punished for it he was half terrified by the 
vague suspicion that there might be some laws which tended to correct in this way 
all the abuses in nature there might be much vice and crime going seemingly unpunished 
but there might also be much correction going on as the suicides and deaths and 
cases of insanity seemed to attest was this true was there no escape from the 
results of evil except by abandoning it entirely he pondered over this gravely getting on 
his feet again financially was not such an easy thing he had been out of 
touch now so long with things artisticthe magazine world and the art agenciesthat he felt 
as if he might not readily be able to get in touch again besides he 
was not at all sure of himself he had made sketches of men and things 
at speonk and of deegan and his gang on the road and of carlotta and 
angela but he felt that they were weak in their importlacking in the force and 
feeling which had once characterized his work he thought of trying his hand at newspaper 
work if he could make any sort of a connectionworking in some obscure newspaper art 
department until he should feel himself able to do better but he did not feel 
at all confident that he could get that his severe breakdown had made him afraid 
of lifemade him yearn for the sympathy of a woman like carlotta or of a 
larger more hopeful more tender attitude and he dreaded looking for anything anywhere besides he 
hated to spare the time unless he were going to get somewhere his work was 
so pressing but he knew he must quit it he thought about it wearily wishing 
he were better placed in this world and finally screwed up his courage to leave 
this work though it was not until something else was quite safely in his hands 
chapter xxx it was only after a considerable lapse of time when trying to live 
on nine dollars a week and seeing angela struggle almost hopelessly in her determination to 
live on what he earned and put a little aside that he came to his 
senses and made a sincere effort to find something better during all this time he 
had been watching her narrowly seeing how systematically she did all her own house work 
even under these adverse and trying circumstances cooking cleaning marketing she made over her old 
clothes reshaping them so that they would last longer and still look stylish she made 
her own hats doing everything in short that she could to make the money in 
the bank hold out until eugene should be on his feet she was willing that 
he should take money and buy himself clothes when she was not willing to spend 
it on herself she was living in the hope that somehow he would reform consciousness 
of what she was worth to him might some day strike him still she did 
not feel that things could ever be quite the same again she could never forget 
and neither could he the affair between eugene and carlotta because of the various forces 
that were militating against it was now slowly drawing to a close it had not 
been able to endure all the storm and stress which followed its discovery for one 
thing carlotta's mother without telling her husband made him feel that he had good cause 
to stay about which made it difficult for carlotta to act besides she charged her 
daughter constantly much as angela was charging eugene with the utmost dissoluteness of character and 
was as constantly putting her on the defensive she was too hedged about to risk 
a separate apartment and eugene would not accept money from her to pay for expensive 
indoor entertainment she wanted to see him but she kept hoping he would get to 
the point where he would have a studio again and she could see him as 
a star in his own field that would be so much nicer by degrees their 
once exciting engagements began to lapse and despite his grief eugene was not altogether sorry 
to tell the truth great physical discomfort recently had painted his romantic tendencies in a 
very sorry light for him he thought he saw in a way where they were 
leading him that there was no money in them was obvious that the affairs of 
the world were put in the hands of those who were content to get their 
life's happiness out of their management seemed quite plain idlers had nothing as a rule 
not even the respect of their fellow men the licentious were worn threadbare and disgraced 
by their ridiculous and psychologically diseased propensities women and men who indulged in these unbridled 
relations were sickly sentimentalists as a rule and were thrown out or ignored by all 
forceful society one had to be strong eager determined and abstemious if wealth was to 
come and then it had to be held by the same qualities one could not 
relax otherwise one became much what he was now a brooding sentimentalistdiseased in mind and 
body so out of loveexcitement and poverty and ill health and abuse he was coming 
to see or thought he was this one fact clearlynamely that he must behave himself 
if he truly wished to succeed did he want to he could not say that 
but he had tothat was the sad part of itand since apparently he had to 
he would do the best he could it was grim but it was essential at 
this time eugene still retained that rather ultra artistic appearance which had characterized his earlier 
years but he began to suspect that on this score he was a little bizarre 
and out of keeping with the spirit of the times certain artists whom he met 
in times past and recently were quite commercial in their appearancethe very successful onesand he 
decided that it was because they put the emphasis upon the hard facts of life 
and not upon the romance connected with their work it impressed him and he decided 
to do likewise abandoning the flowing tie and the rather indiscriminate manner he had of 
combing his hair and thereafter affected severe simplicity he still wore a soft hat because 
he thought it became him best but otherwise he toned himself down greatly his work 
with deegan had given him a sharp impression of what hard earnest labor meant deegan 
was nothing but a worker there was no romance in him he knew nothing about 
romance picks and shovels and mortar boards and concrete formssuch was his life and he 
never complained eugene remembered commiserating him once on having to get up at four a 
m in order to take a train which would get to work by seven darkness 
and cold made no difference to him however shewer i have to be theyre he 
had replied with his quizzical irish grin they're not payin' me me wages fer lyin' 
in bed if ye were to get up that way every day fer a year 
it would make a man of ye oh no said eugene teasingly oh yes said 
deegan it would an' yere the wan that's needin' it i can tell that by 
the cut av ye eugene resented this but it stayed by him deegan had the 
habit of driving home salutary lessons in regard to work and abstemiousness without really meaning 
to the two were wholly representative of himjust those two things and nothing more one 
day he went down into printing house square to see if he could not make 
up his mind to apply at one of the newspaper art departments when he ran 
into hudson dula whom he had not seen for a long while the latter was 
delighted to see him why hello witla he exclaimed shocked to see that he was 
exceptionally thin and pale where have you been all these years i'm delighted to see 
you what have you been doing let's go over here to hahn's and you tell 
me all about yourself i've been sick dula said eugene frankly i had a severe 
case of nervous breakdown and i've been working on the railroad for a change i 
tried all sorts of specialists but they couldn't help me so i decided to go 
to work by the day and see what that would do i got all out 
of sorts with myself and i've been pretty near four years getting back i think 
i am getting better though i'm going to knock off on the road one of 
these days and try my hand at painting again i think i can do it 
isn't that curious replied dula reminiscently i was just thinking of you the other day 
and wondering where you were you know i've quit the art director game truth failed 
and i went into the lithographic business i have a small interest in a plant 
that i'm managing down in bond street i wish you'd come in and see me 
some day i certainly will said eugene now this nervousness of yours said dula as 
they strolled into the restaurant where they were dining i have a brotherinlaw that was 
hit that way he's still doctoring around i'm going to tell him about your case 
you don't look so bad i'm feeling much better said eugene i really am but 
i've had a bad spell of it i'm going to come back in the game 
though i feel sure of it when i do i'll know better how to take 
care of myself i overworked on that first burst of pictures i must say that 
was the best stuff of that kind i ever saw done in this country said 
dula i saw both your shows as you remember they were splendid what became of 
all those pictures oh some were sold and the rest are in storage replied eugene 
curious isn't it said dula i should have thought all those things would have been 
purchased they were so new and forceful in treatment you want to pull yourself together 
and stay pulled you're going to have a great future in that field oh i 
don't know replied eugene pessimistically it's all right to obtain a big reputation but you 
can't live on that you know pictures don't sell very well over here i have 
most of mine left a grocer with one delivery wagon has the best artist that 
ever lived backed right off the board for financial results not quite as bad as 
that said dula smilingly an artist has something which a tradesman can never haveyou want 
to remember that his point of view is worth something he lives in a different 
world spiritually and then financially you can do well enoughyou can live and what more 
do you want you're received everywhere you have what the tradesman cannot possibly attaindistinction and 
you give the world a standard of merityou will at least if i had your 
ability i would never sit about envying any butcher or baker why all the artists 
know you nowthe good ones anyhow it only remains for you to do more to 
obtain more there are lots of things you can do what for instance asked eugene 
why ceilings mural decorations i was saying to someone the other day what a mistake 
it was the boston library did not assign some of their panels to you you 
would make splendid things of them you certainly have a world of faith in me 
replied eugene tingling warmly it was like a glowing fire to hear this after all 
the dreary days then the world still remembered him he was worth while do you 
remember oren benedictyou used to know him out in chicago didn't you i certainly did 
replied eugene i worked with him he's down on the world now in charge of 
the art department there he's just gone there then as eugene exclaimed over the curious 
shifts of time he suddenly added why wouldn't that be a good idea for you 
you say you're just about to knock off why don't you go down and do 
some pen work to get your hand in it would be a good experience for 
you benedict would be glad to put you on i'm sure dula suspected that eugene 
might be out of funds and this would be an easy way for him to 
slip into something which would lead back to studio work he liked eugene he was 
anxious to see him get along it flattered him to think he had been the 
first to publish his work in color that isn't a bad idea said eugene i 
was really thinking of doing something like that if i could i'll go up and 
see him maybe today it would be just the thing i need nowa little preliminary 
practise i feel rather rusty and uncertain i'll call him up if you want said 
dula generously i know him well he was asking me the other day if i 
knew one or two exceptional men you wait here a minute eugene leaned back in 
his chair as dula left could it be that he was going to be restored 
thus easily to something better he had thought it would be so hard now this 
chance was coming to lift him out of his sufferings at the right time dula 
came back he says 'sure' he exclaimed 'come right down' you'd better go down there 
this afternoon that'll be just the thing for you and when you are placed again 
come around and see me where are you living eugene gave him his address that's 
right you're married he added when eugene spoke of himself and angela having a small 
place how is mrs witla i remember her as a very charming woman mrs dula 
and i have an apartment in gramercy place you didn't know i had tied up 
did you well i have bring your wife and come to see us we'll be 
delighted i'll make a dinner date for you two eugene was greatly pleased and elated 
he knew angela would be they had seen nothing of artistic life lately he hurried 
down to see benedict and was greeted as an old acquaintance they had never been 
very chummy but always friendly benedict had heard of eugene's nervous breakdown well i'll tell 
you he said after greeting and reminiscences were over i can't pay very muchfifty dollars 
is high here just at present and i have just one vacancy now at twentyfive 
which you can have if you want to try your hand there's a good deal 
of hurry up about at times but you don't mind that when i get things 
straightened out here i may have something better oh that's all right replied eugene cheerfully 
i'm glad to get that he was very glad indeed and i don't mind the 
hurry it will be good for a change benedict gave him a friendly handshake in 
farewell he was glad to have him for he knew what he could do i 
don't think i can come before monday i have to give a few days' notice 
is that all right i could use you earlier but monday will do said benedict 
and they parted genially eugene hurried back home he was delighted to tell angela for 
this would rob their condition of part of its gloom it was no great comfort 
to him to be starting in as a newspaper artist again at twentyfive dollars a 
week but it couldn't be helped and it was better than nothing at least it 
was putting him back on the track again he was sure to do still better 
after this he could hold this newspaper job he felt and outside that he didn't 
care very much for the time being his pride had received some severe jolts it 
was vastly better than day labor anyway he hurried up the four flights of stairs 
to the cheap little quarters they occupied saying when he saw angela at the gas 
range: well i guess our railroad days are over what's the trouble asked angela apprehensively 
no trouble he replied i have a better job what is it i'm going to 
be a newspaper artist for a while on the world when did you find that 
out she asked brightening for she had been terribly depressed over their state this afternoon 
i'm going to work monday twentyfive dollars will be some better than nine won't it 
angela smiled it certainly will she said and tears of thanksgiving filled her eyes eugene 
knew what those tears stood for he was anxious to avoid painful reminiscences don't cry 
he said things are going to be much better from now on oh i hope 
so i hope so she murmured and he patted her head affectionately as it rested 
on his shoulder there now cheer up girlie will you we're going to be all 
right from now on angela smiled through her tears she set the table exceedingly cheerful 
that certainly is good news she laughed afterward but we're not going to spend any 
more money for a long while anyhow we're going to save something we don't want 
to get in this hole again no more for mine replied eugene gaily not if 
i know my business and he went into the one little combination parlor sitting room 
reception room and general room of all work to open his evening newspaper and whistle 
in his excitement he almost forgot his woes over carlotta and the love question in 
general he was going to climb again in the world and be happy with angela 
he was going to be an artist or a business man or something look at 
hudson dula owning a lithographic business and living in gramercy place could any artist he 
knew do that scarcely he would see about this he would think this art business 
over maybe he could be an art director or a lithographer or something he had 
often thought while he was with the road that he could be a good superintendent 
of buildings if he could only give it time enough angela for her part was 
wondering what this change really spelled for her would he behave now would he set 
himself to the task of climbing slowly and surely he was getting along in life 
he ought to begin to place himself securely in the world if he ever was 
going to her love was not the same as it had formerly been it was 
crossed with dislike and opposition at times but still she felt that he needed her 
to help him poor eugeneif he only were not cursed with this weakness perhaps he 
would overcome it so she mused chapter xxxi the work which eugene undertook in connection 
with the art department of the world was not different from that which he had 
done ten years before in chicago it seemed no less difficult for all his experiencemore 
so if anything for he felt above it these days and consequently out of place 
he wished at once that he could get something which would pay him commensurately with 
his ability to sit down among mere boysthere were men there as old as himself 
and older though of course he did not pay so much attention to themwas galling 
he thought benedict should have had more respect for his talent than to have offered 
him so little though at the same time he was grateful for what he had 
received he undertook energetically to carry out all the suggestions given him and surprised his 
superior with the speed and imagination with which he developed everything he surprised benedict the 
second day with a splendid imaginative interpretation of the black death which was to accompany 
a sunday newspaper article upon the modern possibilities of plagues the latter saw at once 
that eugene could probably only be retained a very little while at the figure he 
had given him he had made the mistake of starting him low thinking that eugene's 
talent after so severe an illness might be at a very low ebb he did 
not know being new to the art directorship of a newspaper how very difficult it 
was to get increases for those under him an advance of ten dollars to anyone 
meant earnest representation and an argument with the business manager and to double and treble 
the salary which should have been done in this case was out of the question 
six months was a reasonable length of time for anyone to wait for an increasesuch 
was the dictate of the business managementand in eugene's case it was ridiculous and unfair 
however being still sick and apprehensive he was content to abide by the situation hoping 
with returning strength and the saving of a little money to put himself right eventually 
angela of course was pleased with the turn of affairs having suffered so long with 
only prospects of something worse in store it was a great relief to go to 
the bank every tuesdayeugene was paid on mondayand deposit ten dollars against a rainy day 
it was agreed between them that they might use six for clothing which angela and 
eugene very much needed and some slight entertainment it was not long before eugene began 
to bring an occasional newspaper artist friend up to dinner and they were invited out 
they had gone without much clothing with scarcely a single visit to the theatre without 
friendseverything now the tide began slowly to change in a little while because they were 
more free to go to places they began to encounter people whom they knew there 
was six months of the drifting journalistic work in which as in his railroad work 
he grew more and more restless and then there came a time when he felt 
as if he could not stand that for another minute he had been raised to 
thirtyfive dollars and then fifty but it was a terrific grind of exaggerated and to 
him thoroughly meretricious art the only valuable results in connection with it were that for 
the first time in his life he was drawing a moderately secure living salary and 
that his mind was fully occupied with details which gave him no time to think 
about himself he was in a large room surrounded by other men who were as 
sharp as knives in their thrusts of wit and restless and greedy in their attitude 
toward the world they wanted to live brilliantly just as he did only they had 
more selfconfidence and in many cases that extreme poise which comes of rare good health 
they were inclined to think he was somewhat of a poseur at first but later 
they came to like himall of them he had a winning smile and his love 
of a joke so keen so bodyshaking drew to him all those who had a 
good story to tell tell that to witla was a common phrase about the office 
and eugene was always listening to someone he came to lunching with first one and 
then another then three or four at a time and by degrees angela was compelled 
to entertain eugene and two or three of his friends twice and sometimes three times 
a week she objected greatly and there was some feeling over that for she had 
no maid and she did not think that eugene ought to begin so soon to 
put the burden of entertainment upon their slender income she wanted him to make these 
things very formal and by appointment but eugene would stroll in genially explaining that he 
had irving nelson with him or henry hare or george beers and asking nervously at 
the last minute whether it was all right angela would say certainly to be sure 
in front of the guests but when they were alone there would be tears and 
reproaches and firm declarations that she would not stand it well i won't do it 
any more eugene would apologize i forgot you know still he wanted angela to get 
a maid and let him bring all who would come it was a great relief 
to get back into the swing of things and see life broadening out once more 
it was not so long after he had grown exceedingly weary of his underpaid relationship 
to the world that he heard of something which promised a much better avenue of 
advancement eugene had been hearing for some time from one source and another of the 
development of art in advertising he had read one or two articles on the subject 
in the smaller magazines had seen from time to time curious and sometimes beautiful series 
of ads run by first one corporation and then another advertising some product he had 
always fancied in looking at these things that he could get up a notable series 
on almost any subject and he wondered who handled these things he asked benedict one 
night going up on the car with him what he knew about it why so 
far as i know said benedict that is coming to be quite a business there 
is a man out in chicago saljerian an american syrianhis father was a syrian but 
he was born over herewho has built up a tremendous business out of designing series 
of ads like that for big corporations he got up that molly maguire series for 
the new cleaning fluid i don't think he does any of the work himself he 
hires artists to do it some of the best men i understand have done work 
for him he gets splendid prices then some of the big advertising agencies are taking 
up that work one of them i know the summerville company has a big art 
department in connection with it they employ fifteen to eighteen men all the time sometimes 
more they turn out some fine ads too to my way of thinking do you 
remember that korno seriesbenedict was referring to a breakfast food which had been advertised by 
a succession of ten very beautiful and very clever pictures yes replied eugene well they 
did that eugene thought of this as a most interesting development since the days in 
which he worked on the alexandria appeal he had been interested in ads the thought 
of ad creation took his fancy it was newer than anything else he had encountered 
recently he wondered if there would not be some chance in that field for him 
his paintings were not selling he had not the courage to start a new series 
if he could make some money first say ten thousand dollars so that he could 
get an interest income of say six or seven hundred dollars a year he might 
be willing to risk art for art's sake he had suffered too muchpoverty had scared 
him so that he was very anxious to lean on a salary or a business 
income for the time being it was while he was speculating over this almost daily 
that there came to him one day a young artist who had formerly worked on 
the worlda youth by the name of morgenbauadolph morgenbauwho admired eugene and his work greatly 
and who had since gone to another paper he was very anxious to tell eugene 
something for he had heard of a change coming in the art directorship of the 
summerville company and he fancied for one reason and another that eugene might be glad 
to know of it eugene had never looked to morgenbau like a man who ought 
to be working in a newspaper art department he was too selfpoised too superior too 
wise morgenbau had conceived the idea that eugene was destined to make a great hit 
of some kind and with that kindling intuition that sometimes saves us whole he was 
anxious to help eugene in some way and so gain his favor i have something 
i'd like to tell you mr witla he observed well what is it smiled eugene 
are you going out to lunch certainly come along they went out together and morgenbau 
communicated to eugene what he had heardthat the summerfield company had just dismissed or parted 
company with or lost a very capable director by the name of freeman and that 
they were looking for a new man why don't you apply for that asked morgenbau 
you could hold it you're doing just the sort of work that would make great 
ads you know how to handle men too they like you all the young fellows 
around here do why don't you go and see mr summerfield he's up in thirtyfourth 
street you might be just the man he's looking for and then you'd have a 
department of your own eugene looked at this boy wondering what had put this idea 
in his head he decided to call up dula and did so at once asking 
him what he thought would be the best move to make the latter did not 
know summerville [sic] but he knew someone who did i'll tell you what you do 
eugene he said you go and see baker bates of the satina company that's at 
the corner of broadway and fourth street we do a big business with the satina 
company and they do a big business with summerfield i'll send a letter over to 
you by a boy and you take that then i'll call bates up on the 
phone and if he's favorable he can speak to summerfield he'll want to see you 
though eugene was very grateful and eagerly awaited the arrival of the letter he asked 
benedict for a little time off and went to mr baker bates the latter had 
heard enough from dula to be friendly he had been told by the latter that 
eugene was potentially a great artist slightly down on his luck but that he was 
doing exceedingly well where he was and would do better in the new place he 
was impressed by eugene's appearance for the latter had changed his style from the semiartistic 
to the practical he thought eugene looked capable he was certainly pleasant i'll talk to 
mr summerfield for you he said though i wouldn't put much hope in what will 
come of it if i were you he's a difficult man and it's best not 
to appear too eager in this matter if he can be induced to send for 
you it will be much better you let this rest until tomorrow i'll call him 
up on another matter and take him out to lunch and then i'll see how 
he stands and who he has in mind if he has anyone he may have 
you know if there is a real opening i'll speak of you we'll see eugene 
went away once more very grateful he was thinking that dula had always meant good 
luck to him he had taken his first important drawing the pictures he had published 
for him had brought him the favor of m charles dula had secured him the 
position that he now had would he be the cause of his getting this one 
on the way down town on the car he encountered a crosseyed boy he had 
understood from someone recently that crosseyed boys were good luckcrosseyed women bad luck a thrill 
of hopeful prognostication passed over him in all likelihood he was going to get this 
place if this sign came true this time he would believe in signs they had 
come true before but this would be a real test he stared cheerfully at the 
boy and the latter looked him full in the eyes and grinned that settles it 
said eugene i'm going to get it still he was far from being absolutely sure 
chapter xxxii the summerfield advertising agency of which mr daniel c summerfield was president was 
one of those curious exfoliations or efflorescences of the personality of a single individual which 
is so often met with in the business world and which always means a remarkable 
individual behind them the ideas the enthusiasm the strength of mr daniel c summerfield was 
all there was to the summerfield advertising agency it was true there was a large 
force of men working for him advertising canvassers advertising writers financial accountants artists stenographers bookkeepers 
and the like but they were all as it were an emanation or irradiation of 
the personality of mr daniel c summerfield he was small wiry blackhaired blackeyed blackmustached with 
an olive complexion and even pleasing albeit at times wolfish white teeth which indicated a 
disposition as avid and hungry as a disposition well might be mr summerfield had come 
up into his present state of affluence or comparative affluence from the direst poverty and 
by the directest routehis personal efforts in the state in which he had originated alabama 
his family had been known in the small circle to which they were known at 
all as poor white trash his father had been a rather lackadaisical halfstarved cotton planter 
who had been satisfied with a single bale or less of cotton to the acre 
on the ground which he leased and who drove a lean mule very much the 
worse for age and wear up and down the furrows of his leaner fields the 
while he complained of the misery in his breast he was afflicted with slow consumption 
or thought he was which was just as effective and in addition had hookworm though 
that parasitic producer of hopeless tiredness was not yet discovered and named daniel christopher his 
eldest son had been raised with scarcely any education having been put in a cotton 
mill at the age of seven but nevertheless he soon manifested himself as the brain 
of the family for four years he worked in the cotton mill and then because 
of his unusual brightness he had been given a place in the printing shop of 
the wickham union where he was so attractive to the slowgoing proprietor that he soon 
became foreman of the printing department and then manager he knew nothing of printing or 
newspapers at the time but the little contact he obtained here soon cleared his vision 
he saw instantly what the newspaper business was and decided to enter it later as 
he grew older he suspected that no one knew very much about advertising as yet 
or very little and that he was called by god to revise it with this 
vision of a still wider field of usefulness in his mind he began at once 
to prepare himself for it reading all manner of advertising literature and practicing the art 
of display and effective statement he had been through such bitter things as personal fights 
with those who worked under him knocking one man down with a heavy iron form 
key personal altercation with his own father and mother in which he frankly told them 
that they were failures and that they had better let him show them something about 
regulating their hopeless lives he had quarreled with his younger brothers trying to dominate them 
and had succeeded in controlling the youngest principally for the very good reason that he 
had become foolishly fond of him this younger brother he later introduced into his advertising 
business he had religiously saved the little he had earned thus far invested a part 
of it in the further development of the wickham union bought his father an eight 
acre farm which he showed him how to work and finally decided to come to 
new york to see if he could not connect himself with some important advertising concern 
where he could learn something more about the one thing that interested him he was 
already married and he brought his young wife with him from the south he soon 
connected himself as a canvasser with one of the great agencies and advanced rapidly he 
was so smiling so bland so insistent so magnetic that business came to him rapidly 
he became the star man in this new york concern and alfred cookman who was 
its owner and manager was soon pondering what he could do to retain him no 
individual or concern could long retain daniel c summerfield however once he understood his personal 
capabilities in two years he had learned all that alfred cookman had to teach him 
and more than he could teach him he knew his customers and what their needs 
were and where the lack was in the service which mr cookman rendered them he 
foresaw the drift toward artistic representation of saleable products and decided to go into that 
side of it he would start an agency which would render a service so complete 
and dramatic that anyone who could afford to use his service would make money when 
eugene first heard of this agency the summerfield concern was six years old and rapidly 
growing it was already very large and profitable and as hard and forceful as its 
owner daniel c summerfield sitting in his private office was absolutely ruthless in his calculations 
as to men he had studied the life of napoleon and had come to the 
conclusion that no individual life was important mercy was a joke to be eliminated from 
business sentiment was silly twaddle the thing to do was to hire men as cheaply 
as possible to drive them as vigorously as possible and to dispose of them quickly 
when they showed signs of weakening under the strain he had already had five art 
directors in as many years had hired and fired as he termed it innumerable canvassers 
ad writers bookkeepers stenographers artistsgetting rid of anyone and everyone who showed the least sign 
of incapacity or inefficiency the great office floor which he maintained was a model of 
cleanliness orderone might almost say beauty of a commercial sort but it was the cleanliness 
order and beauty of a hard polished and welloiled machine daniel c summerfield was not 
much more than that but he had long ago decided that was what he must 
be in order not to be a failure a fool and as he called it 
a mark and he admired himself for being so when mr baker bates at hudson 
dula's request went to mr summerfield in regard to the rumored vacancy which really existed 
the latter was in a most receptive frame of mind he had just come into 
two very important advertising contracts which required a lot of imagination and artistic skill to 
execute and he had lost his art director because of a row over a former 
contract it was true that in very many casesin most cases in facthis customers had 
very definite ideas as to what they wanted to say and how they wanted to 
say it but not always they were almost always open to suggestions as to modifications 
and improvements and in a number of very important cases they were willing to leave 
the entire theory of procedure to the summerfield advertising company this called for rare good 
judgment not only in the preparation but in the placing of these ads and it 
was in the matter of their preparationthe many striking ideas which they should embodythat the 
judgment and assistance of a capable art director of real imagination was most valuable as 
has already been said mr summerfield had had five art directors in almost as many 
years in each case he had used the napoleonic method of throwing a fresh unwearied 
mind into the breach of difficulty and when it wearied or broke under the strain 
tossing it briskly out there was no compunction or pity connected with any detail of 
this method i hire good men and i pay them good wages was his favorite 
comment why shouldn't i expect good results if he was wearied or angered by failure 
he was prone to exclaimthese goddamned cattle of artists what can you expect of them 
they don't know anything outside their little theory of how things ought to look they 
don't know anything about life why god damn it they're like a lot of children 
why should anybody pay any attention to what they think who cares what they think 
they give me a pain in the neck mr daniel c summerfield was very much 
given to swearing more as a matter of habit than of foul intention and no 
picture of him would be complete without the interpolation of his favorite expressions when eugene 
appeared on the horizon as a possible applicant for this delightful position mr daniel c 
summerfield was debating with himself just what he should do in connection with the two 
new contracts in question the advertisers were awaiting his suggestions eagerly one was for the 
nationwide advertising of a new brand of sugar the second for the international display of 
ideas in connection with a series of french perfumes the sale of which depended largely 
upon the beauty with which they could be interpreted to the lay mind the latter 
were not only to be advertised in the united states and canada but in mexico 
also and the fulfilment of the contracts in either case was dependent upon the approval 
given by the advertisers to the designs for newspaper car and billboard advertising which he 
should submit it was a ticklish business worth two hundred thousand dollars in ultimate profits 
and naturally he was anxious that the man who should sit in the seat of 
authority in his art department should be one of real force and talenta genius if 
possible who should through his ideas help him win his golden harvest the right man 
naturally was hard to find the last man had been only fairly capable he was 
dignified meditative thoughtful with considerable taste and apprehension as to what the material situation required 
in driving home simple ideas but he had no great imaginative grasp of life in 
fact no man who had ever sat in the director's chair had ever really suited 
mr summerfield according to him they had all been weaklings dubs fakes hot air artists 
were some of his descriptions of them their problem however was a hard one for 
they had to think very vigorously in connection with any product which he might be 
trying to market and to offer him endless suggestions as to what would be the 
next best thing for a manufacturer to say or do to attract attention to what 
he had to sell it might be a catch phrase such as have you seen 
this new soap or do you know soresdait's red it might be that a novelty 
in the way of hand or finger eye or mouth was all that was required 
carrying some appropriate explanation in type sometimes as in the case of very practical products 
their very practical display in some clear interesting attractive way was all that was needed 
in most cases though something radically new was required for it was the theory of 
mr summerfield that his ads must not only arrest the eye but fix themselves in 
the memory and convey a fact which was or at least could be made to 
seem important to the reader it was a struggling with one of the deepest and 
most interesting phases of human psychology the last man older freeman had been of considerable 
use to him in his way he had collected about him a number of fairly 
capable artistsmen temporarily down on their luckwho like eugene were willing to take a working 
position of this character and from them he had extracted by dint of pleading cajoling 
demonstrating and the like a number of interesting ideas their working hours were from nine 
to fivethirty their pay meagreeighteen to thirtyfive with experts drawing in several instances fifty and 
sixty dollars and their tasks innumerable and really neverending their output was regulated by a 
tabulated record system which kept account of just how much they succeeded in accomplishing in 
a week and how much it was worth to the concern the ideas on which 
they worked were more or less products of the brains of the art director and 
his superior though they occasionally themselves made important suggestions but for their proper execution the 
amount of time spent on them the failures sustained the art director was more or 
less responsible he could not carry to his employer a poor drawing of a good 
idea or a poor idea for something which required a superior thought and long hope 
to retain his position mr daniel c summerfield was too shrewd and too exacting he 
was really tireless in his energy it was his art director's business he thought to 
get him good ideas for good drawings and then to see that they were properly 
and speedily executed anything less than this was sickening failure in the eyes of mr 
summerfield and he was not at all bashful in expressing himself as a matter of 
fact he was at times terribly brutal why the hell do you show me a 
thing like that he once exclaimed to freeman jesus christ i could hire an ashman 
and get better results why god damn it look at the drawing of the arm 
of that woman look at her ear whose going to take a thing like that 
it's tame it's punk it's a joke what sort of cattle have you got out 
there working for you anyhow why if the summerfield advertising company can't do better than 
that i might as well shut up the place and go fishing we'll be a 
joke in six weeks don't try to hand me any such god damned tripe as 
that freeman you know better you ought to know our advertisers wouldn't stand for anything 
like that wake up i'm paying you five thousand a year how do you expect 
i'm going to get my money back out of any such arrangement as that you're 
simply wasting my money and your time letting a man draw a thing like that 
hell the art director whoever he was having been by degrees initiated into the brutalities 
of the situation and havingby reason of the time he had been employed and the 
privileges he had permitted himself on account of his comfortable and probably never before experienced 
salarysold himself into bondage to his now fancied necessities was usually humble and tractable under 
the most galling fire where could he go and get five thousand dollars a year 
for his services how could he live at the rate he was living if he 
lost this place art directorships were not numerous men who could fill them fairly acceptably 
were not impossible to find if he thought at all and was not a heavenborn 
genius serene in the knowledge of his godgiven powers he was very apt to hesitate 
to worry to be humble and to endure a good deal most men under similar 
circumstances do the same thing they think before they fling back into the teeth of 
their oppressors some of the slurs and brutal characterizations which so frequently issue therefrom most 
men do besides there is almost always a high percentage of truth in the charges 
made usually the storm is for the betterment of mankind mr summerfield knew this he 
knew also the yoke of poverty and the bondage of fear which most if not 
all his men were under he had no compunctions about using these weapons much as 
a strong man might use a club he had had a hard life himself no 
one had sympathized with him very much besides you couldn't sympathize and succeed better look 
the facts in the face deal only with infinite capacity roughly weed out the incompetents 
and proceed along the line of least resistance in so far as your powerful enemies 
were concerned men might theorize and theorize until the crack of doom but this was 
the way the thing had to be done and this was the way he preferred 
to do it eugene had never heard of any of these facts in connection with 
the summerfield company the idea had been flung at him so quickly he had no 
time to think and besides if he had had time it would have made no 
difference a little experience of life had taught him as it teaches everyone else to 
mistrust rumor he had applied for the place on hearing and he was hoping to 
get it at noon the day following his visit to mr baker bates the latter 
was speaking for him to mr summerfield but only very casually say he asked quite 
apropos of nothing apparently for they were discussing the chances of his introducing his product 
into south america do you ever have need of an art director over in your 
place occasionally replied summerfield guardedly for his impression was that mr baker bates knew very 
little of art directors or anything else in connection with the art side of advertising 
life he might have heard of his present need and be trying to palm off 
some friend of his an incompetent of course on him what makes you ask why 
hudson dula the manager of the triple lithographic company was telling me of a man 
who is connected with the world who might make a good one for you i 
know something of him he painted some rather remarkable views of new york and paris 
here a few years ago dula tells me they were very good is he young 
interrupted summerfield calculating yes comparatively thirtyone or two i should say and he wants to 
be an art director does he where is he he's down on the world and 
i understand he wants to get out of there i heard you say last year 
that you were looking for a man and i thought this might interest you what's 
he doing down on the world he's been sick i understand and is just getting 
on his feet again the explanation sounded sincere enough to summerfield what's his name he 
asked witla eugene witla he had an exhibition at one of the galleries here a 
few years ago i'm afraid of these regular highbrow artists observed summerfield suspiciously they're usually 
so set up about their art that there's no living with them i have to 
have someone with hard practical sense in my work someone that isn't a plain damn 
fool he has to be a good managera good administrator mere talent for drawing won't 
dothough he has to have that or know it when he sees it you might 
send this fellow around sometime if you know him i wouldn't mind looking at him 
i may need a man pretty soon i'm thinking of making certain changes if i 
see him i will said baker indifferently and dropped the matter summerfield however for some 
psychological reason was impressed with the name where had he heard it somewhere apparently perhaps 
he had better find out something about him if you send him you'd better give 
him a letter of introduction he added thoughtfully before bates should have forgotten the matter 
so many people try to get in to see me and i may forget baker 
knew at once that summerfield wished to look at witla he dictated a letter of 
introduction that afternoon to his stenographer and mailed it to eugene i find mr summerfield 
apparently disposed to see you he wrote you had better go and see him if 
you are interested present this letter very truly yours eugene looked at it with astonishment 
and a sense of foregoneness so far as what was to follow fate was fixing 
this for him he was going to get it how strange life was here he 
was down on the world working for fifty dollars a week and suddenly an art 
directorship a thing he had thought of for years was coming to him out of 
nowhere then he decided to telephone mr daniel summerfield saying that he had a letter 
from mr baker bates and asking when he could see him later he decided to 
waste no time but to present the letter direct without phoning at three in the 
afternoon he received permission from benedict to be away from the office between three and 
five and at threethirty he was in the anteroom of the general offices of the 
summerfield advertising company waiting for a much desired permission to enter chapter xxxiii when eugene 
called mr daniel c summerfield was in no great rush about any particular matter but 
he had decided in this case as he had in many others that it was 
very important that anyone who wanted anything from him should be made to wait eugene 
was made to wait a solid hour before he was informed by an underling that 
he was very sorry but that other matters had so detained mr summerfield that it 
was now impossible for him to see him at all this day but that tomorrow 
at twelve he would be glad to see him eugene was finally admitted on the 
morrow however and then at the first glance mr summerfield liked him a man of 
intelligence he thought as he leaned back in his chair and stared at him a 
man of force young still wideeyed quick clean looking perhaps i have found someone in 
this man who will make a good art director he smiled for summerfield was always 
goodnatured in his opening relationshipsusually so in all of them and took most people his 
employees and prospective employees particularly with an air of superior but genial condescension sit down 
sit down he exclaimed cheerfully and eugene did so looking about at the handsomely decorated 
walls the floor which was laid with a wide soft light brown rug and the 
mahogany desk flattopped glass covered on which lay handsome ornaments of silver ivory and bronze 
this man looked so keen so dynamic like a polished japanese carving hard and smooth 
now tell me all about yourself began summerfield where do you come from who are 
you what have you done hold hold said eugene easily and tolerantly not so fast 
my history isn't so much the short and simple annals of the poor i'll tell 
you in two or three sentences summerfield was a little taken back at this abruptness 
which was generated by his own attitude still he liked it this was something new 
to him his applicant wasn't frightened or apparently even nervous so far as he could 
judge he is droll he thought sufficiently soa man who has seen a number of 
things evidently he is easy in manner too and kindly well he said smilingly for 
eugene's slowness appealed to him his humor was something new in art directors so far 
as he could recall his predecessors had never had any to speak of well i'm 
an artist said eugene working on the world let's hope that don't militate against me 
very much it don't said summerfield and i want to become an art director because 
i think i'd make a good one why asked summerfield his even teeth showing amiably 
well because i like to manage men or i think i do and they take 
to me you know that i do in the next place i know too much 
about art to want to do the little things that i'm doing i can do 
bigger things i like that also applauded summerfield he was thinking that eugene was nice 
and good looking a little pale and thin to be wholly forceful perhaps he wasn't 
sure his hair a little too long his manner perhaps a bit too deliberate still 
he was nice why did he wear a soft hat why did artists always insist 
on wearing soft hats most of them it was so ridiculous so unbusinesslike how much 
do you get he added if it's a fair question less than i'm worth said 
eugene only fifty dollars but i took it as a sort of health cure i 
had a nervous breakdown several years agobetter now as mulvaney used to sayand i don't 
want to stay at that i'm an art director by temperament or i think i 
am anyhow here i am you mean said summerfield you never ran an art department 
before never know anything about advertising i used to think so how long ago was 
that when i worked on the alexandria illinois daily appeal summerfield smiled he couldn't help 
it that's almost as important as the wickham union i fancy it sounds as if 
it might have the same wide influence oh much more much more returned eugene quietly 
the alexandria appeal had the largest exclusively country circulation of any county south of the 
sangamon i see i see replied summerfield goodhumoredly it's all day with the wickham union 
well how was it you came to change your mind well i got a few 
years older for one thing said eugene and then i decided that i was cut 
out to be the greatest living artist and then i came to new york and 
in the excitement i almost lost the idea i see but i have it again 
thank heaven tied up back of the house and here i am well witla to 
tell you the truth you don't look like a real live every day sureenough art 
director but you might make good you're not quite arty enough according to the standards 
that prevail around this office still i might be willing to take one goshawful chance 
i suppose if i do i'll get stung as usual but i've been stung so 
often that i ought to be used to it by now i feel sort of 
spotted at times from the hornets i've hired in the past but be that as 
it may what do you think you could do with a real live art directorship 
if you had it eugene mused this persiflage entertained him he thought summerfield would hire 
him now that they were together oh i'd draw my salary first and then i'd 
see that i had the proper system of approach so that any one who came 
to see me would think i was the king of england and then i'd i 
was really busy yesterday interpolated summerfield apologetically i'm satisfied of that replied eugene gaily and 
finally i might condescend if i were coaxed enough to do a little work this 
speech at once irritated and amused mr summerfield he liked a man of spirit you 
could do something with someone who wasn't afraid even if he didn't know so much 
to begin with and eugene knew a good deal he fancied besides his talk was 
precisely in his own sarcastic semihumorous vein coming from eugene it did not sound so 
hard as it would have coming from himself but it had his own gay bantering 
attitude of mind in it he believed eugene could make good he wanted to try 
him instanter anyhow well i'll tell you what witla he finally observed i don't know 
whether you can run this thing or notthe probabilities are all against you as i 
have said but you seem to have some ideas or what might be made some 
under my direction and i think i'll give you a chance mind you i haven't 
much confidence my personal likes usually prove very fatal to me still you're here and 
i like your looks and i haven't seen anyone else and so thanks said eugene 
don't thank me you have a hard job ahead of you if i take you 
it's no child's play you'd better come with me first and look over the place 
and he led the way out into the great central room where because it was 
still noon time there were few people working but where one could see just how 
imposing this business really was seventytwo stenographers bookkeepers canvassers and writers and tradeaid people at 
their desks he observed with an easy wave of his hand and moved on into 
the art department which was in another wing of the building where a north and 
east light could be secured here's where you come in he observed throwing open the 
door where thirtytwo artists' desks and easels were ranged eugene was astonished you don't employ 
that many do you he asked interestedly most of the men were out to lunch 
from twenty to twentyfive all the time sometimes more he said some on the outside 
it depends on the condition of business and how much do you pay them as 
a rule well that depends i think i'll give you seventyfive dollars a week to 
begin with if we come to an understanding if you make good i'll make it 
a hundred dollars a week inside of three months it all depends the others we 
don't pay so much the business manager can tell you eugene noticed the evasion his 
eyes narrowed still there was a good chance here seventyfive dollars was considerably better than 
fifty and it might lead to more he would be his own bossa man of 
some consequence he could not help stiffening with pride a little as he looked at 
the room which summerfield pointed out to him as his own if he camea room 
where a large highly polished oak desk was placed and where some of the summerfield 
advertising company's art products were hung on the walls there was a nice rug on 
the floor and some leatherbacked chairs here's where you will be if you come here 
said summerfield eugene gazed round certainly life was looking up how was he to get 
this place on what did it depend his mind was running forward to various improvements 
in his affairs a better apartment for angela better clothes for her more entertainment for 
both of them freedom from worry over the future for a little bank account would 
soon result from a place like this do you do much business a year eugene 
asked curiously oh about two million dollars' worth and you have to make drawings for 
every ad exactly not one but six or eight sometimes it depends upon the ability 
of the art director if he does his work right i save money eugene saw 
the point what became of the other man he asked noting the name of older 
freeman on the door oh he quit said summerville or rather he saw what was 
coming and got out of the way he was no good he was too weak 
he was turning out work here which was a jokesome things had to be done 
over eight and nine times eugene discovered the wrath and difficulties and opposition which went 
with this summerfield was a hard man plainly he might smile and joke now but 
anyone who took that chair would hear from him constantly for a moment eugene felt 
as though he could not do it as though he had better not try it 
and then he thought why shouldn't i it can't hurt me if worst comes to 
worst i have my art to fall back on well so it goes he said 
if i don't make good the door for mine i suppose no no nothing so 
easy chuckled summerfield the coal chute eugene noticed that he champed his teeth like a 
nervous horse and that he seemed fairly to radiate waves of energy for himself he 
winced the least bit this was a grim fighting atmosphere he was coming into he 
would have to fight for his life hereno doubt of that now said summerfield when 
they were strolling back to his own office i'll tell you what you might do 
i have two propositions one from the sand perfume company and another from the american 
crystal sugar refining company which may mean big contracts for me if i can present 
them the right line of ideas for advertising they want to advertise the sand company 
wants suggestions for bottles labels car ads newspaper ads posters and so on the american 
crystal company wants to sell its sugar in small packages powdered grained cubed hexagoned we 
want package forms labels posters ads and so on for that it's a question of 
how much novelty simplicity and force we can put in the smallest possible space now 
i depend upon my art director to tell me something about these things i don't 
expect him to do everything i'm here and i'll help him i have men in 
the trade aid department out there who are wonders at making suggestions along this line 
but the art director is supposed to help he's the man who is supposed to 
have the taste and can execute the proposition in its last form now suppose you 
take these two ideas and see what you can do with them bring me some 
suggestions if they suit me and i think you have the right note i'll hire 
you if not well then i won't and no harm done is that all right 
that's all right said eugene mr summerfield handed him a bundle of papers catalogues prospectuses 
communications you can look these over if you want to take them along and then 
bring them back eugene rose i'd like to have two or three days for this 
he said it's a new proposition to me i think i can give you some 
ideasi'm not sure anyhow i'd like to try go ahead go ahead said summerfield the 
more the merrier and i'll see you any time you're ready i have a man 
out therefreeman's assistantwho's running things for me temporarily here's luck and he waved his hand 
indifferently eugene went out was there ever such a man so hard so cold so 
practical it was a new note to him he was simply astonished largely because he 
was inexperienced he had not yet gone up against the business world as those who 
try to do anything in a big way commercially must this man was getting on 
his nerves already making him feel that he had a tremendous problem before him making 
him think that the quiet realms of art were merely the backwaters of oblivion those 
who did anything who were out in the front row of effort were fighters such 
as this man was raw products of the soil ruthless superior indifferent if only he 
could be that way he thought if he could be strong defiant commanding what a 
thing it would be not to wince not to quail but to stand up firm 
square to the world and make people obey oh what a splendid vision of empire 
was here before him chapter xxxiv the designs or suggestions which eugene offered his prospective 
employer for the advertising of the products of m sand et cie and the american 
crystal sugar refining company were peculiar as has been indicated eugene had one of those 
large effervescent intelligences which when he was in good physical condition fairly bubbled ideas his 
imaginings without any effort on his part naturally took all forms and shapes the call 
of mr summerfield was for street car cards posters and newspaper ads of various sizes 
and what he wanted eugene specifically to supply was not so much the lettering or 
rather wording of the ads as it was their artistic form and illustrative point: what 
one particular suggestion in the form of a drawing or design could be made in 
each case which would arrest public attention eugene went home and took the sugar proposition 
under consideration first he did not say anything of what he was really doing to 
angela because he did not want to disappoint her he pretended that he was making 
sketches which he might offer to some company for a little money and because it 
amused him by the light of his green shaded working lamp at home he sketched 
designs of hands holding squares of sugar either in the fingers or by silver and 
gold sugar tongs urns piled high with crystalline concoctions a blue and gold afterdinner cup 
with one lump of the new form on the side against a section of snow 
white table cloth and things of that character he worked rapidly and with ease until 
he had some thirtyfive suggestions on this one proposition alone and then he turned his 
attention to the matter of the perfumery his first thought was that he did not 
know all the designs of the company's bottles but he originated peculiar and delightful shapes 
of his own some of which were afterwards adopted by the company he designed boxes 
and labels to amuse himself and then made various stilllife compositions such as a box 
a bottle a dainty handkerchief and a small white hand all showing in a row 
his mind slipped to the manufacture of perfume the growing of flowers the gathering of 
blossoms the type of girls and men that might possibly be employed and then he 
hurried to the great public library the next day to see if he could find 
a book or magazine article which would tell him something about it he found this 
and several articles on sugar growing and refining which gave him new ideas in that 
direction he decided that in each case he would put a beautifully designed bottle of 
perfume or a handsome package of sugar say in the upper right or lower lefthand 
corner of the design and then for the rest show some scene in the process 
of its manufacture he began to think of men who could carry out his ideas 
brilliantly if they were not already on his staff letterers character artists men with a 
keen sense of color combination whom he might possibly hire cheaply he thought of jerry 
mathews of the old chicago globe dayswhere was he nowand philip shotmeyer who would be 
almost ideal to work under his direction for he was a splendid letterer and henry 
hare still of the world with whom he had frequently talked on the subject of 
ads and posters then there was young morgenbau who was a most excellent character man 
looking to him for some opportunity and eight or ten men whose work he had 
admired in the magazinesthe best known ones he decided first to see what could be 
done with the staff that he had and then to eliminate and fill in as 
rapidly as possible until he had a capable working group he had already caught by 
contact with summerfield some of that eager personage's ruthlessness and began to manifest it in 
his own attitude he was most impressionable to things advantageous to himself and this chance 
to rise to a higher level out of the slough of poverty in which he 
had so greatly suffered nerved him to the utmost effort in two days he had 
a most impressive mass of material to show his prospective employer and he returned to 
his presence with considerable confidence the latter looked over his ideas carefully and then began 
to warm to his attitude of mind i should say he said generously there's some 
life to this stuff i can see you getting the five thousand a year all 
right if you keep on you're a little new but you've caught the drift and 
he sat down to show him where some improvements from a practical point of view 
could be made now professor he said finally when he was satisfied that eugene was 
the man he wanted you and i might as well call this a deal it's 
pretty plain to me that you've got something that i want some of these things 
are fine i don't know how you're going to make out as a master of 
men but you might as well take that desk out there and we'll begin right 
now i wish you luck i really do you're a live wire i think eugene 
thrilled with satisfaction this was the result he wanted no halfhearted commendation but enthusiastic praise 
he must have it he always felt that he could command it people naturally ran 
after him he was getting used to it by nowtaking it as a matter of 
course if he hadn't broken down curse the luck think where he could have been 
today he had lost five years and he was not quite well yet but thank 
god he was getting steadily better and he would try and hold himself in check 
from now on the world demanded it he went out with summerfield into the art 
room and was there introduced by him to the various men employed mr davis mr 
witla mr hart mr witla mr clemens mr witla so it went and the staff 
was soon aware of who he was summerfield then took him into the next room 
and introduced him to the various heads of departments the business manager who fixed his 
and his artists' salaries the cashier who paid him the manager of the ad writing 
department the manager of the trade aid department and the head of the stenographic department 
a woman eugene was a little disgusted with what he considered the crassness of these 
people after the quality of the art atmosphere in which he had moved these people 
seemed to him somewhat raw and voracious like fish they had no refinement their looks 
and manners were unduly aggressive he resented particularly the fact that one canvasser with whom 
he shook hands wore a bright red tie and had on yellow shoes the insistence 
on department store models for suits and floorwalker manners pained him to hell with such 
cattle he thought but on the surface he smiled and shook hands and said how 
glad he would be to work with them finally when all the introductions were over 
he went back to his own department to take up the work which rushed through 
here like a living stream pellmell his own staff was of course much more agreeable 
to him these artists who worked for him interested him for they were as he 
suspected men very much like himself in poor health probably or down on their luck 
and compelled to do this he called for his assistant mr davis whom summerfield had 
introduced to him as such and asked him to let him see how the work 
stood have you a schedule of the work in hand he asked easily yes sir 
said his new attendant let me see it the latter brought what he called his 
order book and showed him just how things worked each particular piece of work or 
order as it was called was given a number when it came in the time 
of its entry marked on the slip the name of the artist to whom it 
was assigned the time taken to execute it and so forth if one artist only 
put two hours on it and another took it and put four this was noted 
if the first drawing was a failure and a second begun the records would show 
all the slips and errors of the office as well as its speed and capacity 
eugene perceived that he must see to it that his men did not make many 
mistakes after this order book had been carefully inspected by him he rose and strolled 
about among the men to see how they were getting on he wanted to familiarize 
himself at once with the styles and methods of his men some were working on 
clothing ads some on designs illustrative of the beef industry some on a railroad travel 
series for the street cars and so forth eugene bent over each one graciously for 
he wanted to make friends with these people and win their confidence he knew from 
experience how sensitive artists werehow they could be bound by feelings of good fellowship he 
had a soft easy smiling manner which he hoped would smooth his way for him 
he leaned over this man's shoulder and that asking what the point was how long 
a piece of work of that character ought to take suggesting where a man appeared 
to be in doubt what he thought would be advisable he was not at all 
certain of himselfthis line of work being so newbut he was hopeful and eager it 
was a fine sensation this being a boss if one could only triumph at it 
he hoped to help these men to help themselves to make them make good in 
ways which would bring them and him more money he wanted more moneythat five thousand 
no less i think you have the right idea there he said to one pale 
anæmic worker who looked as though he might have a lot of talent the man 
whose name was dillon responded to the soothing caressing tone of his voice he liked 
eugene's appearance though he was not at all disposed to pass favorable judgment as yet 
it was already rumored that he had had an exceptional career as an artist summerfield 
had attended to that he looked up and smiled and said do you think so 
i certainly do said eugene cheerfully try a touch of yellow next to that blue 
see if you don't like that the artist did as requested and squinted at it 
narrowly it helps it a lot don't it he observed as though it were his 
own it certainly does said eugene that's a good idea and somehow dillon felt as 
though he had thought of it inside of twenty minutes the whole staff was agreeing 
with itself that he was a nice man to all outward appearances and that he 
might make good he appeared to be so sure they little knew how perturbed he 
was inwardly how anxious he was to get all the threads of this in his 
hand and to see that everything came to an ideal fruition he dreaded the hour 
when he might have something to contend with which was not quite right days passed 
at this new work and then weeks and by degrees he grew moderately sure of 
himself and comparatively easy in his seat though he realized that he had not stepped 
into a bed of roses he found this a most tempestuous office to work in 
for summerfield was as he expressed it on the job early and late and tireless 
in his insistence and enthusiasm he came down from his residence in the upper portion 
of the city at eightfifty in the morning and remained almost invariably until sixthirty and 
seven and not infrequently until eight and nine in the evening he had the inconsiderate 
habit of keeping such of his staff as happened to be working upon the thing 
in which he was interested until all hours of the night sometimes transferring his deliberations 
to his own home and that without dinner or the proffer of it to those 
whom he made to work he would talk advertising with one big merchant or another 
until it was time to go home and would then call in the weary members 
of his staff before they had time to escape and begin a long and important 
discussion of something he wanted done at times when anything went wrong he would fly 
into an insane fury rave and curse and finally perhaps discharge the one who was 
really not to blame there were no end of labored and irritating conferences in which 
hard words and sarcastic references would fly about for he had no respect for the 
ability or personality of anyone who worked for him they were all more or less 
machines in his estimation and rather poorly constructed ones at that their ideas were not 
good enough unless for the time being they happened to be new or as in 
eugene's case displaying pronounced talent he could not fathom eugene so readily for he had 
never met anyone of his kind he was looking closely in his case as he 
was in that of all the others to see if he could not find some 
weakness in his ideas he had a gleaming insistent almost demoniac eye a habit of 
chewing incessantly and even violently the stub end of a cigar the habit of twitching 
getting up and walking about stirring things on his desk doing anything and everything to 
give his restless generative energy a chance to escape now professor he would say when 
eugene came in and seated himself quietly and unobtrusively in some corner we have a 
very difficult thing here to solve today i want to know what you think could 
be done in such and such a case describing a particular condition eugene would brace 
himself up and begin to consider but rumination was not what summerfield wanted from anyone 
well professor well well he would exclaim eugene would stir irritably this was so embarrassingin 
a way so degrading to him come to life professor summerfield would go on he 
seemed to have concluded long before that the gad was the most effective commercial weapon 
eugene would then make some polite suggestion wishing instead that he could tell him to 
go to the devil but that was not the end of it before all the 
old writers canvassers trade aid mensometimes one or two of his own artists who might 
be working upon the particular task in question he would exclaim: lord what a poor 
suggestion or can't you do any better than that professor or good heavens i have 
three or four ideas better than that myself the best he would ever say in 
conference was well there may be something in that though privately afterwards he might possibly 
express great pleasure past achievements counted for nothing that was so plain one might bring 
in gold and silver all day long the next day there must be more gold 
and silver and in larger quantities there was no end to the man's appetite there 
was no limit to the speed at which he wished to drive his men there 
was no limit to the venomous commercial idea as an idea summerfield set an example 
of nagging and irritating insistence and he urged all his employees to the same policy 
the result was a beargarden a den of prizefighters liars cutthroats and thieves in which 
every man was for himself openly and avowedly and the devil take the hindmost chapter 
xxxv still time went by and although things did not improve very much in his 
office over the standards which he saw prevailing when he came there he was obviously 
getting things much better arranged in his private life in the first place angela's attitude 
was getting much better the old agony which had possessed her in the days when 
he was acting so badly had modified as day by day she saw him working 
and conducting himself with reasonable circumspection she did not trust him as yet she was 
not sure that he had utterly broken with carlotta wilson she had never found out 
who his paramour was but all the evidence seemed to attest it there was a 
telephone down stairs in a drug store by which during his days on the world 
angela would call him up at any time and whenever she had called him up 
he was always in the office he seemed to have plenty of time to take 
her to the theatre if she wished to go and to have no especial desire 
to avoid her company he had once told her frankly that he did not propose 
to pretend to love her any more though he did care for her and this 
frightened her in spite of her wrath and suffering she cared for him and she 
believed that he still sympathized with her and might come to care for her againthat 
he ought to she decided to play the rôle of the affectionate wife whether it 
was true or not and to hug and kiss him and fuss over him if 
he would let her just as though nothing had happened eugene did not understand this 
he did not see how angela could still love him he thought she must hate 
him having such just grounds for having by dint of hard work and absence come 
out of his vast excitement about carlotta he was beginning to feel that he had 
done her a terrific injustice and to wish to make amends he did not want 
to love her he did not feel that he could but he was perfectly willing 
to behave himself to try to earn a good living to take her to theatre 
and opera as opportunity permitted and to build up and renew a social relationship with 
others which should act as a substitute for love he was beginning to think that 
there was no honest or happy solution to any affair of the heart in the 
world most people so far as he could see were unhappily married it seemed to 
be the lot of mankind to make mistakes in its matrimonial selections he was probably 
no more unhappy than many others let the world wag as it would for a 
time he would try to make some money now and restore himself in the eyes 
of the world later life might bring him somethingwho could tell in the next place 
their financial condition even before he left the world was so much better than it 
had been by dint of saving and scraping refusing to increase their expenses more than 
was absolutely necessary angela had succeeded by the time he left the world in laying 
by over one thousand dollars and since then it had gone up to three thousand 
they had relaxed sufficiently so that now they were wearing reasonably good clothes were going 
out and receiving company regularly it was not possible in their little apartment which they 
still occupied to entertain more than three or four at the outside and two was 
all that angela ever cared to consider as either pleasurable or comfortable but they entertained 
this number frequently there were some slight recoveries of friendship and of the old lifehudson 
dula jerry mathews who had moved to newark william mcconnell philip shotmeyer machugh and smite 
were away one painting in nova scotia the other working in chicago as for the 
old art crowd socialists and radicals included eugene attempted to avoid them as much as 
possible he knew nothing of the present whereabouts of miriam finch and norma whitmore of 
christina channing he heard much for she was singing in grand opera her pictures displayed 
in the paper and upon the billboards there were many new friends principally young newspaper 
artists like adolph morgenbau who took to eugene and were in a sense his disciples 
angela's relations showed up from time to time among them david blue now a sublieutenant 
in the army with all the army officer's pride of place and station there were 
women friends of angela's for whom eugene cared littlemrs desmas the wife of the furniture 
manufacturer at riverwood from whom they had rented their four rooms there mrs wertheim the 
wife of the multimillionaire to whom m charles had introduced them mrs link the wife 
of the west point army captain who had come to the old washington square studio 
with marietta and who was now stationed at fort hamilton in brooklyn and a mrs 
juergens living in a neighboring apartment as long as they were very poor angela was 
very careful how she revived acquaintances but when they began to have a little money 
she decided that she might indulge her predilection and so make life less lonesome for 
herself she had always been anxious to build up solid social connections for eugene but 
as yet she did not see how it was to be done when eugene's new 
connection with the summerfield company was consummated angela was greatly astonished and rather delighted to 
think that if he had to work in this practical field for long it was 
to be under such comforting auspicesthat is as a superior and not as an underling 
long ago she had come to feel that eugene would never make any money in 
a commercial way to see him mounting in this manner was curious but not wholly 
reassuring they must save money that was her one cry they had to move soon 
that was very plain but they mustn't spend any more than they had to she 
delayed until the attitude of summerfield upon an accidental visit to their flat made it 
commercially advisable summerfield was a great admirer of eugene's artistic ability he had never seen 
any of his pictures but he was rather keen to and once when eugene told 
him that they were still on display one or two of them at pottle frères 
jacob bergman's and henry larue's he decided to visit these places but put it off 
one night when he was riding uptown on the l road with eugene he decided 
because he was in a vagrom mood to accompany him home and see his pictures 
there eugene did not want this he was chagrined to be compelled to take him 
into their very little apartment but there was apparently no way of escaping it he 
tried to persuade him to visit pottle frères instead where one picture was still on 
view but summerfield would none of that i don't like you to see this place 
finally he said apologetically as they were going up the steps of the fivestory apartment 
house we are going to get out of here pretty soon i came here when 
i worked on the road summerfield looked about at the poor neighborhood the inlet of 
a canal some two blocks east where a series of black coal pockets were and 
to the north where there was flat open country and a railroad yard why that's 
all right he said in his direct practical way it doesn't make any difference to 
me it does to you though witla you know i believe in spending money everybody 
spending money nobody gets anywhere by saving anything pay out pay outthat's the idea i 
found that out for myself long ago you'd better move when you get a chance 
soon and surround yourself with clever people eugene considered this the easy talk of a 
man who was successful and lucky but he still thought there was much in it 
summerfield came in and viewed the pictures he liked them and he liked angela though 
he wondered how eugene ever came to marry her she was such a quiet little 
home body eugene looked more like a bohemian or a club man now that he 
had been worked upon by summerfield the soft hat had long since been discarded for 
a stiff derby and eugene's clothes were of the most practical business type he could 
find he looked more like a young merchant than an artist summerfield invited them over 
to dinner at his house refusing to stay to dinner here and went his way 
before long because of his advice they moved they had practically four thousand by now 
and because of his salary angela figured that they could increase their living expenses to 
say two thousand five hundred or even three thousand dollars she wanted eugene to save 
two thousand each year against the day when he should decide to return to art 
they sought about together saturday afternoons and sundays and finally found a charming apartment in 
central park west overlooking the park where they thought they could live and entertain beautifully 
it had a large diningroom and livingroom which when the table was cleared away formed 
one great room there was a handsomely equipped bathroom a nice kitchen with ample pantry 
three bedrooms one of which angela turned into a sewing room and a square hall 
or entry which answered as a temporary reception room there were plenty of closets gas 
and electricity elevator service with nicely uniformed elevator men and a house telephone it was 
very different from their last place where they only had a long dark hall stairways 
to climb gas only and no phone the neighborhood too was so much better here 
were automobiles and people walking in the park or promenading on a sunday afternoon and 
obsequious consideration or polite indifference to your affairs from everyone who had anything to do 
with you well the tide is certainly turning said eugene as they entered it the 
first day he had the apartment redecorated in white and delftblue and dark blue getting 
a set of library and diningroom furniture in imitation rosewood he bought a few choice 
pictures which he had seen at various exhibitions to mix with his own and set 
a cutglass bowl in the ceiling where formerly the commonplace chandelier had been there were 
books enough accumulated during a period of years to fill the attractive white bookcase with 
its leadpaned doors attractive sets of bedroom furniture in bird'seye maple and white enamel were 
secured and the whole apartment given a very cosy and tasteful appearance a piano was 
purchased outright and dinner and breakfast sets of haviland china there were many other dainty 
accessories such as rugs curtains portières and so forth the hanging of which angela supervised 
here they settled down to a comparatively new and attractive life angela had never really 
forgiven him his indiscretions of the past his radical brutality in the last instance but 
she was not holding them up insistently against him there were occasional scenes even yet 
the echoes of a faroff storm but as long as they were making money and 
friends were beginning to come back she did not propose to quarrel eugene was very 
considerate he was very very hardworking why should she nag him he would sit by 
a window overlooking the park at night and toil over his sketches and ideas until 
midnight he was up and dressed by seven down to his office by eightthirty out 
to lunch at one or later and only back home at eight or nine o'clock 
at night sometimes angela would be cross with him for this sometimes rail at mr 
summerfield for an inhuman brute but seeing that the apartment was so lovely and that 
eugene was getting along so well how could she quarrel it was for her benefit 
as much as for his that he appeared to be working he did not think 
about spending money he did not seem to care he would work work work until 
she actually felt sorry for him certainly mr summerfield ought to like you she said 
to him one day half in compliment half in a rage at a man who 
would exact so much from him you're valuable enough to him i never saw a 
man who could work like you can don't you ever want to stop don't bother 
about me angelface he said i have to do it i don't mind it's better 
than walking the streets and wondering how i'm going to get alongand he fell to 
his ideas again angela shook her head poor eugene if ever a man deserved success 
for working he certainly did and he was really getting nice againgetting conventional perhaps it 
was because he was getting a little older it might turn out that he would 
become a splendid man after all chapter xxxvi there came a time however when all 
this excitement and wrath and quarreling began to unnerve eugene and to make him feel 
that he could not indefinitely stand the strain after all his was the artistic temperament 
not that of a commercial or financial genius he was too nervous and restless for 
one thing he was first astonished then amused then embittered by the continual travesty on 
justice truth beauty sympathy which he saw enacted before his eyes life stripped of its 
illusion and its seeming becomes a rather deadly thing to contemplate because of the ruthless 
insistent inconsiderate attitude of this employer all the employees of this place followed his example 
and there was neither kindness nor courtesynor even raw justice anywhere eugene was compelled to 
see himself looked upon from the beginning not so much by his own staff as 
by the other employees of the company as a man who could not last long 
he was disliked forsooth because summerfield displayed some liking for him and because his manners 
did not coincide exactly with the prevailing standard of the office summerfield did not intend 
to allow his interest in eugene to infringe in any way upon his commercial exactions 
but this was not enough to save or aid eugene in any way the others 
disliked him some because he was a true artist to begin with because of his 
rather distant air and because in spite of himself he could not take them all 
as seriously as he should most of them seemed little mannikins to himlittle second third 
and fourth editions or copies of summerfield they all copied that worthy's insistent air they 
all attempted to imitate his briskness like children they were inclined to try to imitate 
his bitter persiflage and be smart and they demanded as he said they should the 
last ounce of consideration and duty from their neighbors eugene was too much of a 
philosopher not to take much of this with a grain of salt but after all 
his position depended on his activity and his ability to get results and it was 
a pity he thought that he could expect neither courtesy nor favor from anyone departmental 
chiefs stormed his room daily demanding this that and the other work immediately artists complained 
that they were not getting enough pay the business manager railed because expenses were not 
kept low saying that eugene might be an improvement in the matter of the quality 
of the results obtained and the speed of execution but that he was lavish in 
his expenditure others cursed openly in his presence at times and about him to his 
employer alleging that the execution of certain ideas was rotten or that certain work was 
delayed or that he was slow or discourteous there was little in these things as 
summerfield well knew from watching eugene but he was too much a lover of quarrels 
and excitement as being productive of the best results in the long run to wish 
to interfere eugene was soon accused of delaying work generally of having incompetent men which 
was true of being slow of being an artistic snob he stood it all calmly 
because of his recent experience with poverty but he was determined to fight ultimately he 
was no longer or at least not going to be he thought the ambling cowardly 
dreaming witla he had been he was going to stand up and he did begin 
to remember you are the last word here witla summerfield had told him on one 
occasion if anything goes wrong here you're to blame don't make any mistakes don't let 
anyone accuse you falsely don't run to me i won't help you it was such 
a ruthless attitude that it shocked eugene into an attitude of defiance in time he 
thought he had become a hardened and a changed managgressive contentious bitter they can all 
go to hell he said one day to summerfield after a terrific row about some 
delayed pictures in which one man who was animated by personal animosity more than anything 
else had said hard things about him the thing that's been stated here isn't so 
my work is up to and beyond the mark this individual herepointing to the man 
in questionsimply doesn't like me the next time he comes into my room nosing about 
i'll throw him out he's a damned fakir and you know it he lied here 
today and you know that good for you witla exclaimed summerfield joyously the idea of 
a fighting attitude on eugene's part pleased him you're coming to life you'll get somewhere 
now you've got the ideas but if you let these wolves run over you they'll 
do it and they'll eat you i can't help it they're all no good i 
wouldn't trust a single goddamned man in the place so it went eugene smiled could 
he ever get used to such a life could he ever learn to live with 
such cheap inconsiderate indecent little pups summerfield might like them but he didn't this might 
be a marvellous business policy but he couldn't see it somehow it seemed to reflect 
the mental attitude and temperament of mr daniel c summerfield and nothing more human nature 
ought to be better than that it is curious how fortune sometimes binds up the 
wounds of the past covers over the broken places as with clinging vines gives to 
the miseries and mental wearinesses of life a look of sweetness and comfort an illusion 
of perfect joy is sometimes created where still underneath are cracks and scars here were 
angela and eugene living together now beginning to be visited by first one and then 
the other of those they had known in the past seemingly as happy as though 
no storm had ever beset the calm of their present sailing eugene despite all his 
woes was interested in this work he liked to think of himself as the captain 
of a score of men having a handsome office desk being hailed as chief by 
obsequious subordinates and invited here and there by summerfield who still liked him the work 
was hard but it was so much more profitable than anything he had ever had 
before angela was happier too he thought than she had been in a long time 
for she did not need to worry about money and his prospects were broadening friends 
were coming back to them in a steady stream and they were creating new ones 
it was possible to go to a seaside resort occasionally winter or summer or to 
entertain three or four friends at dinner angela had a maid the meals were served 
with considerable distinction under her supervision she was flattered to hear nice things said about 
her husband in her presence for it was whispered abroad in art circles with which 
they were now slightly in touch again that half the effectiveness of the summerfield ads 
was due to eugene's talent it was no shame for him to come out now 
and say where he was for he was getting a good salary and was a 
department chief he or rather the house through him had made several great hits issuing 
series of ads which attracted the attention of the public generally to the products which 
they advertised experts in the advertising world first and then later the public generally were 
beginning to wonder who it was that was primarily responsible for the hits the summerfield 
company had not had them during the previous six years of its history there were 
too many of them coming close together not to make a new era in the 
history of the house summerfield it was understood about the office was becoming a little 
jealous of eugene for he could not brook the presence of a man with a 
reputation and eugene with his five thousand dollars in cash in two savings banks with 
practically two thousand five hundred dollars' worth of tasteful furniture in his apartment and with 
a tenthousand lifeinsurance policy in favor of angela was carrying himself with quite an air 
he was not feeling so anxious about his future angela noted it summerfield also the 
latter felt that eugene was beginning to show his artistic superiority in a way which 
was not entirely pleasant he was coming to have a direct insistent sometimes dictatorial manner 
all the driving summerfield had done had not succeeded in breaking his spirit instead it 
had developed him from a lean pale artistic soul wearing a soft hat he had 
straightened up and filled out until now he looked more like a business man than 
an artist with a derby hat clothes of the latest cut a ring of oriental 
design on his middle finger and pins and ties which reflected the prevailing modes eugene's 
attitude had not as yet changed completely but it was changing he was not nearly 
so fearsome as he had been he was beginning to see that he had talents 
in more directions than one and to have the confidence of this fact five thousand 
dollars in cash with two or three hundred dollars being added monthly and interest at 
four per cent being paid upon it gave him a reserve of selfconfidence he began 
to joke summerfield himself for he began to realize that other advertising concerns might be 
glad to have him word had been brought to him once that the alfred cookman 
company of which summerfield was a graduate was considering making him an offer and the 
twinecampbell company the largest in the field was also interested in what he was doing 
his own artists mostly faithful because he had sought to pay them well and to 
help them succeed had spread his fame greatly according to them he was the sole 
cause of all the recent successes which had come to the house which was not 
true at all a number perhaps the majority of things recently had started with him 
but they had been amplified by summerfield worked over by the adwriting department revised by 
the advertisers themselves and so on and so forth until notable changes had been effected 
and success achieved there was no doubt that eugene was directly responsible for a share 
of this his presence was inspiring constructive he keyed up the whole tone of the 
summerfield company merely by being there but he was not all there was to it 
by many a long step he realized this himself he was not at all offensively 
egotisticsimply surer calmer more genial less easily ruffled but even this was too much summerfield 
wanted a frightened man and seeing that eugene might be getting strong enough to slip 
away from him he began to think how he should either circumvent his possible sudden 
flight or discredit his fame so that if he did leave he would gain nothing 
by it neither of them was directly manifesting any illwill or indicating his true feelings 
but such was the situation just the same the things which summerfield thought he might 
do were not easy to do under any circumstances it was particularly hard in eugene's 
case the man was beginning to have an air people liked him advertisers who met 
him the big manufacturers took note of him they did not understand him as a 
trade figure but thought he must have real force one mana great real estate plunger 
in new york who saw him once in summerfield's officespoke to the latter about him 
that's a most interesting man you have there that man witla he said when they 
were out to lunch together where does he come from oh the west somewhere replied 
summerfield evasively i don't know i've had so many art directors i don't pay much 
attention to them winfield exsenator kenyon c winfield of brooklyn perceived a slight undercurrent of 
opposition and belittling he looks like a bright fellow he said intending to drop the 
subject he is he is returned summerfield but like all artists he's flighty they're the 
most unstable people in the world you can't depend upon them good for one idea 
todayworth nothing tomorrowi have to handle them like a lot of children the weather sometimes 
makes all the difference in the world winfield fancied this was true artists generally were 
worth nothing in business still he remembered eugene pleasantly as summerfield talked here so was 
it in the office and elsewhere he began to say in the office and out 
that eugene was really not doing as well as he might and that in all 
likelihood he would have to drop him it was sad but all directors even the 
best of them had their little day of ability and usefulness and then ran to 
seed he did not see why it was that all these directors failed so but 
they did they never really made good in the company by this method his own 
undiminished ability was made to stand out free and clear and eugene was not able 
to appear as important no one who knew anything about eugene however at this time 
believed this but they did believein the officethat he might lose his position he was 
too brighttoo much of a leader they felt that this condition could not continue in 
a oneman concern and this made the work harder for it bred disloyalty in certain 
quarters some of his men were disposed to counsel with the enemy but as time 
passed and in spite of the change of attitude which was coming over summerfield eugene 
became even stronger in his own selfesteem he was not getting vainglorious as yetmerely sure 
because of his art work his art connections had revived considerably and he had heard 
again from such men as louis deesa m charles luke severas and others who now 
knew where he was and wondered why he did not come back to painting proper 
m charles was disgusted a great error he said he always spoke of him to 
others as a great loss to art strange to relate one of his pictures was 
sold the spring following his entry into the summerfield company and another the following winter 
each netted him two hundred and fifty dollars pottle frères being the agents in one 
case jacob bergman in the other these sales with their consequent calls for additional canvases 
to show cheered him greatly he felt satisfied now that if anything happened to him 
he could go back to his art and that he could make a living anyhow 
there came a time when he was sent for by mr alfred cookman the advertising 
agent for whom summerfield had worked but nothing came of that for the latter did 
not care to pay more than six thousand a year and summerfield had once told 
eugene that he would eventually pay him ten thousand if he stayed with him he 
did not think it was fair to leave him just then and besides cookman's firm 
had not the force and go and prestige which summerfield had at this time his 
real chance came some six months later when one of the publishing houses of philadelphia 
having an important weekly to market began looking for an advertising manager it was the 
policy of this house to select young men and to select from among all the 
available candidates just the one particular one to suit the fancy of the owner and 
who had a record of successful effort behind him now eugene was not any more 
an advertising manager by experience than he was an art director but having worked for 
summerfield for nearly two years he had come to know a great deal about advertising 
and the public thought he knew a great deal more he knew by now just 
how summerfield had his business organized he knew how he specialized his forces giving this 
line to one and that line to another he had been able to learn by 
sitting in conferences and consultations what it was that advertisers wanted how they wanted their 
goods displayed what they wanted said he had learned that novelty force and beauty were 
the keynotes and he had to work these elements out under the most galling fire 
so often that he knew how it ought to be done he knew also about 
commissions rebates longtime contracts and so forth he had fancied more than once that he 
might run a little advertising business of his own to great profit if he only 
could find an honest and capable business manager or partner since this person was not 
forthcoming he was content to bide his time but the kalvin publishing company of philadelphia 
had heard of him in his search for a man obadiah kalvin the founder of 
the company had examined many individuals through agents in chicago in st louis in baltimore 
boston and new york but he had not yet made up his mind he was 
slow in his decisions and always flattered himself that once he made a selection he 
was sure of a good result he had not heard of eugene until toward the 
end of his search but one day in the union club in philadelphia when he 
was talking to a big advertising agent with whom he did considerable business the latter 
said: i hear you are looking for an advertising manager for your weekly i am 
he said i heard of a man the other day who might suit you he's 
with the summerfield company in new york they've been getting up some very striking ads 
of late as you may have noticed i think i have seen some of them 
replied kalvin i'm not sure of the man's namewitla or gitla or some such thing 
as that but anyhow he's over there and they say he's pretty good just what 
he is in the house i don't know you might look him up thanks i 
will replied kalvin he was really quite grateful for he was not quite satisfied with 
any of those he had seen or heard of he was an old man extremely 
sensitive to ability wanting to combine force with refinement if he could he was a 
good christian and was running christian or rather their happy correlatives decidedly conservative publications when 
he went back to his office he consulted with his business partner a man named 
fredericks who held but a minor share in the company and asked him if he 
couldn't find out something about this promising individual fredericks did so he called up cookman 
in new york who was delighted to injure his old employee summerfield to the extent 
of taking away his best man if he could he told fredericks that he thought 
eugene was very capable probably the most capable young man in the field and in 
all likelihood the man he was looking fora hustler i thought once of hiring him 
myself here not long ago he told fredericks he has ideas you can see that 
the next thing was a private letter from mr fredericks to mr witla asking if 
by any chance he could come over to philadelphia the following saturday afternoon indicating that 
there was a business proposition of considerable importance which he wished to lay before him 
from the paper on which it was written eugene could see that there was something 
important in the wind and laid the matter before angela the latter's eyes glistened i'd 
certainly go if i were you she advised he might want to make you business 
manager or art director or something you can be sure they don't intend to offer 
you less than you're getting now and mr summerfield certainly has not treated you very 
well anyhow you've worked like a slave for him and he's never kept his agreement 
to raise your salary as much as he said he would it may mean our 
having to leave new york but that doesn't make any difference for a while you 
don't intend to stay in this field anyhow you only want to stay long enough 
to get a good sound income of your own angela's longing for eugene's art career 
was nevertheless being slightly stilled these days by the presence and dangled lure of money 
it was a great thing to be able to go downtown and buy dresses and 
hats to suit the seasons it was a fine thing to be taken by eugene 
saturday afternoons and sundays in season to atlantic city to spring lake and shelter island 
i think i will go over he said and he wrote mr fredericks a favorable 
reply the latter met him at the central station in philadelphia with his auto and 
took him out to his country place in the haverford district on the way he 
talked of everything but businessthe state of the weather the condition of the territory through 
which they were traveling the day's news the nature and interest of eugene's present work 
when they were in the fredericks house where they arrived in time for dinner and 
while they were getting ready for it mr obadiah kalvin dropped inostensibly to see his 
partner but really to look at eugene without committing himself he was introduced to eugene 
and shook hands with him cordially during the meal he talked with eugene a little 
though not on business and eugene wondered why he had been called he suspected knowing 
as he did that kalvin was the president of the company that the latter was 
there to look at him after dinner mr kalvin left and eugene noted that mr 
fredericks was then quite ready to talk with him the thing that i wanted you 
to come over and see me about is in regard to our weekly and the 
advertising department we have a great paper over here as you know he said we 
are intending to do much more with it in the future than we have in 
the past even mr kalvin is anxious to get just the man to take charge 
of the advertising department we have been looking for someone for quite a little while 
several people have suggested your name and i'm rather inclined to think that mr kalvin 
would be pleased to see you take it his visit here today was purely accidental 
but it was fortunate he had a chance to look at you so that if 
i should propose your name he will know just who you are i think you 
would find this company a fine background for your efforts we have no pennywiseandpoundfoolish policy 
over here we know that any successful thing is made by the men behind it 
and we are willing to pay good money for good men i don't know what 
you are getting where you are and i don't care very much if you are 
interested i should like to talk to mr kalvin about you and if he is 
interested i should like to bring you two together for a final conference the salary 
will be made right you needn't worry about that mr kalvin isn't a small man 
if he likes a manand i think he might like youhe'll offer you what he 
thinks you're worth and you can take it or leave it i never heard anyone 
complain about the salary he offered eugene listened with extreme selfgratulation he was thrilling from 
head to toe this was the message he had been expecting to hear for so 
long he was getting five thousand now he had been offered six thousand mr kalvin 
could do no less than offer him seven or eightpossibly ten he could easily ask 
seven thousand five hundred i must say he said innocently the proposition sounds attractive to 
me it's a different kind of thingsomewhatfrom what i have been doing but i think 
i could handle it successfully of course the salary will determine the whole thing i'm 
not at all badly placed where i am i've just got comfortably settled in new 
york and i'm not anxious to move but i would not be opposed to coming 
i have no contract with mr summerfield he has never been willing to give me 
one well we are not keen upon contracts ourselves said mr fredericks it's not a 
very strong reed to lean upon anyhow as you know still a contract might be 
arranged if you wish it supposing we talk a little further to mr kalvin today 
he doesn't live so far from here and with eugene's consent he went to the 
phone the latter had supposed that the conversation with mr kalvin was something which would 
necessarily have to take place at some future date but from the conversation then and 
there held over the phone it appeared not mr fredericks explained elaborately over the phoneas 
though it was necessarythat he had been about the work of finding an advertising manager 
for some time as mr kalvin knew and that he had some difficulty in finding 
the right man i have been talking to mr witla whom you met here today 
and he is interested in what i have been telling him about the weekly he 
strikes me from my talk with him here as being possibly the man you are 
looking for i thought that you might like to talk with him further mr kalvin 
evidently signified his assent for the machine was called out and they traveled to his 
house perhaps a mile away on the way eugene's mind was busy with the possibilities 
of the future it was all so nebulous this talk of a connection with the 
famous kalvin publishing company but at the same time it was so significant so potential 
could it be possible that he was going to leave summerfield after all and under 
such advantageous circumstances it seemed like a dream mr kalvin met them in the library 
of his house which stood in a spacious lawn and which save for the lights 
in the library was quite dark and apparently lonely and here their conversation was continued 
he was a quiet mansmall grayhaired searching in his gaze he had as eugene noted 
little hands and feet and appeared as still and composed as a pool in dull 
weather he said slowly and quietly that he was glad that eugene and mr fredericks 
had had a talk he had heard a little something of eugene in the past 
not much he wanted to know what eugene thought of current advertising policies what he 
thought of certain new developments in advertising method and so on at some length so 
you think you might like to come with us he observed drily toward the end 
as though eugene had proposed coming i don't think i would object to coming under 
certain conditions he replied and what are those conditions well i would rather hear what 
you have to suggest mr kalvin i really am not sure that i want to 
leave where i am i'm doing pretty well as it is well you seem a 
rather likely young man to me said mr kalvin you have certain qualities which i 
think i need i'll say eight thousand for this year and if everything is satisfactory 
one year from this time i'll make it ten after that we'll let the future 
take care of itself eight thousand ten next year thought eugene the title of advertising 
manager of a great publication this was certainly a step forward well that isn't so 
bad he said after a moment's apparent reflection i'd be willing to take that i 
think i thought you would said mr kalvin with a dry smile well you and 
mr fredericks can arrange the rest of the details let me wish you good luck 
and he extended his hand cordially eugene took it it did not seem as he 
rode back in the machine with mr fredericks to the latter's housefor he was invited 
to stay for the nightthat it could really be true eight thousand a year was 
he eventually going to become a great business man instead of an artist he could 
scarcely flatter himself that this was true but the drift was strange eight thousand this 
year ten the next if he made good twelve fifteen eighteen he had heard of 
such salaries in the advertising field alone and how much more would his investments bring 
him he foresaw an apartment on riverside drive in new york a house in the 
country perhaps for he fancied he would not always want to live in the city 
an automobile of his own perhaps a grand piano for angela sheraton or chippendale furniture 
friends famewhat artist's career could compare to this did any artist he knew enjoy what 
he was enjoying now even why should he worry about being an artist did they 
ever get anywhere would the approval of posterity let him ride in an automobile now 
he smiled as he recalled dula's talk about class superioritythe distinction of being an artist 
even though poor poverty be hanged posterity could go to the devil he wanted to 
live nownot in the approval of posterity chapter xxxvii the best positions are not always 
free from the most disturbing difficulties for great responsibility goes with great opportunity but eugene 
went gaily to this new task for he knew that it could not possibly be 
much more difficult than the one he was leaving truly summerfield had been a terrible 
man to work for he had done his best by petty nagging insisting on endless 
variations the most frank and brutal criticism to break down eugene's imperturbable good nature and 
make him feel that he could not reasonably hope to handle the situation without summerfield's 
cooperation and assistance but he had only been able by so doing to bring out 
eugene's better resources his selfreliance coolness under fire ability to work long and ardently even 
when his heart was scarcely in it were all strengthened and developed well luck to 
you witla he said when eugene informed him one morning that he was going to 
leave and wished to give him notice you needn't take me into consideration i don't 
want you to stay if you're going to go the quicker the better these long 
drawnout agonies over leaving don't interest me there's nothing in that clinch the job today 
if you want it i'll find someone eugene resented his indifference but he only smiled 
a cordial smile in reply i'll stay a little while if you want me toone 
or two weeksi don't want to tie up your work in any way oh no 
no you won't tie up my work on your way and good luck the little 
devil thought eugene but he shook hands and said he was sorry summerfield grinned imperturbably 
he wound up his affairs quickly and got out thank god he said the day 
he left i'm out of that hell hole but he came to realize afterward that 
summerfield had rendered him a great service he had forced him to do his best 
and utmost which no one had ever done before it had told in his character 
his spiritual makeup his very appearance he was no longer timid and nervous but rather 
bold and determinedlooking he had lost that fear of very little things for he had 
been sailing through stormy seas little storms did notcould never againreally frighten him he had 
learned to fight that was the one great thing summerfield had done for him in 
the offices of the kalvin company it was radically different here was comparative peace and 
quiet kalvin had not fought his way up by clubbing little people through little difficulties 
but had devoted himself to thinking out a few big things and letting them because 
of their very bigness and newness make their own way and his he believed in 
big men honest menthe biggest and most honest he could find he saw something in 
eugene a tendency toward perfection perhaps which attracted him the formalities of this new arrangement 
were soon concluded and eugene came into his new and beautiful offices heralded by the 
word recently passed about that he was a most charming man he was greeted by 
the editor townsend miller in the most cordial manner he was met by his assembled 
staff in the most friendly spirit it quite took eugene's breath away to realize that 
he was the responsible head of some fifteen capable advertising men here in philadelphia alone 
to say nothing of eight more in a branch office in chicago and traveling canvassers 
in the different parts of the countrythe far west the south the southwest the canadian 
northwest his material surroundings were much more imposing than they had been with the summerfield 
company the idea of all these men was to follow up business to lay interesting 
propositions before successful merchants and manufacturers who had not yet tried the columns of the 
north american weekly to make contracts which should be mutually advantageous to the advertiser and 
the weekly and to gain and retain goodwill according to the results rendered it was 
no very difficult task in connection with the north american weekly to do this because 
owing to a novel and appealing editorial policy it was already in possession of a 
circulation of five hundred thousand a week and was rapidly gaining more it was not 
difficult as eugene soon found to show advertisers in most cases that this was a 
proposition in which worthwhile results could be obtained what with eugene's fertility in suggesting new 
methods of advertising his suaveness of approach and geniality in laying before the most recalcitrant 
his very desirable schemes his ability to get ideas and suggestions out of his men 
in conference he was really in no danger of not being able to hold his 
own and indeed was destined to make a rather remarkable showing eugene and angela settled 
into what might have been deemed a fixed attitude of comfort and refinement without much 
inconvenience to himself and with little friction among those about he had succeeded in reorganizing 
his staff along lines which were eminently satisfactory to himself some men who were formerly 
with the summerfield company were now with him he had brought them because he found 
he could inculcate in them the spirit of sympathetic relationship and good understanding such as 
kalvin desired he was not making the progress which summerfield was making with really less 
means at his command but then on the other hand this was a rich company 
which did not ask or expect any such struggle as that which summerfield had been 
and was still compelled to make for himself the business ethics of this company were 
high it believed in clean methods good salaries honest service kalvin liked him and he 
had one memorable conversation with eugene some time after he came therealmost a yearwhich stuck 
in his memory and did him much good kalvin saw clearly wherein both his strength 
and his weakness lay and once said to fredericks his business manager: the one thing 
i like about that man is his readiness with ideas he always has one and 
he's the most willing man to try i ever knew he has imagination he needs 
to be steadied in the direction of sober thought so that he doesn't promise more 
than he can fulfil outside this i see nothing the matter with him fredericks agreed 
he liked eugene also he did as much as he could to make things smooth 
but of course eugene's task was personal and to be worked out by him solely 
kalvin said to him when it became necessary to raise his salary: i've watched your 
work for a year now and i'm going to keep my word and raise your 
salary you're a good man you have many excellent qualities which i want and need 
in the man who sits at that desk but you have also some failings i 
don't want you to get offended a man in my position is always like a 
father who sits at the head of a family and my lieutenants are like my 
sons i have to take an interest in them because they take an interest in 
me now you've done your work wellvery well but you are subject to one fault 
which may sometime lead into trouble you're a little too enthusiastic i don't think you 
stop to think enough you have a lot of ideas they swarm in your head 
like bees and sometimes you let them all out at once and they buzz around 
you and confuse you and everyone else connected with you you would really be a 
better man if you had not less ideasi wouldn't say thatbut better control of them 
you want to do too many things at once go slow take your time you 
have lots of time you're young yet think if you're in doubt come down and 
consult with me i'm older in this business than you are and i'll help you 
all i can eugene smiled and said: i think that's true it is true said 
kalvin and now i want to speak of another thing which is a little more 
of a personal matter and i don't want you to take offence for i'm saying 
it for your benefit if i'm any judge of men and i flatter myself sometimes 
that i am you're a man whose greatest weakness liesand mind you i have no 
actual evidence to go upon not one scrapyour greatest weakness lies perhaps not so much 
in the direction of women as in a love of luxury generally of which women 
might become and usually are a very conspicuous part eugene flushed the least bit nervously 
and resentfully for he thought he had conducted himself in the most circumspect manner herein 
fact everywhere since the days he had begun to put the riverwood incident behind him 
now i suppose you wonder why i say that well i raised two boys both 
dead now and one was just a little like you you have so much imagination 
that it runs not only to ideas in business but ideas in dress and comfort 
and friends and entertainment be careful of the kind of people you get in with 
stick to the conservative element it may be hard for you but it's best for 
you materially speaking you're the kind of man if my observations and intuitions are correct 
who is apt to be carried away by his ideals of anythingbeauty women show now 
i have no ascetic objections to women but to you they are dangerous as yet 
at bottom i don't think you have the making of a real cold business man 
in you but you're a splendid lieutenant i'll tell you frankly i don't think a 
better man than you has ever sat or could sit in that chair you are 
very exceptional but your very ability makes you an uncertain quantity you're just on the 
threshold of your career this additional two thousand dollars is going to open up new 
opportunities to you keep cool keep out of the hands of clever people don't let 
subtle women come near you're married and for your sake i hope you love your 
wife if you don't pretend to and stay within the bounds of convention don't let 
any scandal ever attach to you if you do it will be absolutely fatal so 
far as i am concerned i have had to part with a number of excellent 
men in my time because a little money turned their heads and they went wild 
over some one woman or many women don't you be that way i like you 
i'd like to see you get along be cold if you can be careful think 
that's the best advice i can give you and i wish you luck he waved 
him a dismissal and eugene rose he wondered how this man had seen so clearly 
into his character it was the truth and he knew it was his inmost thoughts 
and feelings were evidently written where this man could see them fittingly was he president 
of a great company he could read men he went back into his office and 
decided to take this lesson to heart he must keep cool and sane always i 
guess i've had enough experience to know that though by now he said and dismissed 
the idea from his mind for this year and the year following when his salary 
was raised to twelve thousand eugene flourished prodigiously he and miller became better friends than 
ever miller had advertising ideas which were of value to eugene eugene had art and 
editorial ideas which were of value to miller they were together a great deal at 
social functions and were sometimes hailed by their companions as the kalvin kids and the 
limelight twins eugene learned to play golf with miller though he was a slow student 
and never good and also tennis he and mrs miller angela and townsend frequently made 
a set on their own court or over at miller's they automobiled and rode a 
great deal eugene met some charming women particularly young ones at dances of which he 
had become very fond and at dinners and receptions they and the millers were invited 
to a great many affairs but by degrees it became apparent to him as it 
did to miller and mrs miller that his presence was much more desired by a 
certain type of smart woman than was that of his wife oh he is so 
clever was an observation which might have been heard in various quarters frequently the compliment 
stopped there and nothing was said of angela or later on it would come up 
that she was not quite so nice not that she was not charming and worthy 
and all that but you know my dear she isn't quite so available you can't 
use her as you can some women it was at this time that angela first 
conceived the notion seriously that a child might have a sobering effect on eugene she 
had in spite of the fact that for some time now they had been well 
able to support one or more and in spite also of the fact that eugene's 
various emotional lapses indicated that he needed a sobering weight of some kind steadily objected 
in her mind to the idea of subjecting herself to this ordeal to tell the 
truth aside from the care and worry which always owing to her early experience with 
her sister's children had been associated in her mind with the presence of them she 
was decidedly afraid of the result she had heard her mother say that most girls 
in their infancy showed very clearly whether they were to be good healthy mothers or 
notwhether they were to have childrenand her recollection was that her mother had once said 
that she would not have any children she half believed it to be impossible in 
her case though she had never told this to eugene and she had guarded herself 
jealously against the chance of having any now however after watching eugene all these years 
seeing the drift of his present mood feeling the influence of prosperity on him she 
wished sincerely that she might have one without great danger or discomfort to herself in 
order that she might influence and control him he might learn to love it the 
sense of responsibility involved would have its effect people would look to him to conduct 
himself soberly under these circumstances and he probably wouldhe was so subject to public opinion 
now she thought of this a long time wondering for fear and annoyance were quite 
strong influences with her and she did nothing immediately she listened to various women who 
talked with her from time to time about the child question and decided that perhaps 
it was very wrong not to have childrenat least one or two that it was 
very likely possible that she could have one if she wanted to a mrs sanifore 
who called on her quite frequently in philadelphiashe met her at the millers'told her that 
she was sure she could have one even if she was past the usual age 
for first babies for she had known so many women who had if i were 
you mrs witla i would see a doctor she suggested one day he can tell 
you i'm sure you can if you want to they have so many ways of 
dieting and exercising you which make all the difference in the world i'd like to 
have you come some day and see my doctor if you will angela decided that 
she would for curiosity's sake and in case she wished to act in the matter 
some time and was informed by the wiseacre who examined her that in his opinion 
there was no doubt that she could she would have to subject herself to a 
strict regimen her muscles would have to be softened by some form of manipulation otherwise 
she was apparently in a healthy normal condition and would suffer no intolerable hardship this 
pleased and soothed angela greatly it gave her a club wherewith to strike her lorda 
chain wherewith to bind him she did not want to act at once it was 
too serious a matter she wanted time to think but it was pleasant to know 
that she could do this unless eugene sobered down now during the time in which 
he had been working for the summerfield company and since then for the kalvin company 
here in philadelphia eugene in spite of the large salary he was receivingmore each yearreally 
had not saved so much money angela had seen to it that some of his 
earnings were invested in pennsylvania railroad stock which seemed to her safe enough and in 
a plot of ground two hundred by two hundred feet at upper montclair new jersey 
near new york where she and eugene might some day want to live his business 
engagements had necessitated considerable personal expenditures his opportunity to enter the baltusrol golf club the 
yere tennis club the philadelphia country club and similar organizations had taken annual sums not 
previously contemplated and the need of having a modest automobile not a touring car was 
obvious his short experience with that served as a lesson however for it was found 
to be a terrific expense entirely disproportionate to his income after paying for endless repairs 
salarying a chauffeur wearisomely and meeting with an accident which permanently damaged the looks of 
his machine he decided to give it up they could rent autos for all the 
uses they would have and so that luxury ended there it was curious too how 
during this time their western home relations fell rather shadowily into the background eugene had 
not been home now for nearly two years and angela had seen only david of 
all her family since she had been in philadelphia in the fall of their third 
year there angela's mother died and she returned to blackwood for a short time the 
following spring eugene's father died myrtle moved to new york her husband frank bangs was 
connected with a western furniture company which was maintaining important show rooms in new york 
myrtle had broken down nervously and taken up christian science eugene heard henry burgess sylvia's 
husband had become president of the bank with which he had been so long connected 
and had sold his father's paper the alexandria appeal when the latter suddenly died marietta 
was promising to come to philadelphia next year in order as she said that eugene 
might get her a rich husband but angela informed him privately that marietta was now 
irrevocably engaged and would the next year marry a wealthy wisconsin lumber man everyone was 
delighted to hear that eugene was doing so well though all regretted the lapse of 
his career as an artist his fame as an advertising man was growing and he 
was thought to have considerable weight in the editorial direction of the north american weekly 
so he flourished chapter xxxviii it was in the fall of the third year that 
the most flattering offer of any was made him and that without any seeking on 
his part for he was convinced that he had found a fairly permanent berth and 
was happy among his associates publishing and other trade conditions were at this time in 
a peculiar condition in which lieutenants of any importance in any field might well be 
called to positions of apparently extraordinary prominence and trust most of the great organizations of 
eugene's day were already reaching a point where they were no longer controlled by the 
individuals who had founded and constructed them but had passed into the hands of sons 
or holding companies or groups of stockholders few of whom knew much if anything of 
the businesses which they were called to engineer and protect hiram c colfax was not 
a publisher at all at heart he had come into control of the swintonscudderdavis company 
by one of those curious manipulations of finance which sometimes give the care of sheep 
into the hands of anything but competent or interested shepherds colfax was sufficiently alert to 
handle anything in such a way that it would eventually make money for him even 
if that result were finally attained by parting with it in other words he was 
a financier his father had been a new england soap manufacturer and having accumulated more 
or less radical ideas along with his wealth had decided to propagandize in favor of 
various causes the single tax theory of henry george for one socialism for another the 
promotion of reform ideas in politics generally he had tried in various ways to get 
his ideas before the public but had not succeeded very well he was not a 
good speaker not a good writer simply a good money maker and fairly capable thinker 
and this irritated him he thought once of buying or starting a newspaper in boston 
but investigation soon showed him that this was a rather hazardous undertaking he next began 
subsidizing small weeklies which should advocate his reforms but this resulted in little his interest 
in pamphleteering did bring his name to the attention of martin w davis of the 
swintonscudderdavis company whose imprint on books magazines and weeklies was as common throughout the length 
and breadth of the land as that of oxford is upon the english bible the 
swintonscudderdavis company was in sad financial straits intellectually for various reasons it had run to 
seed john jacob swinton and owen v scudder the men with book magazine and true 
literary instincts were long since dead mr davis had tried for the various heirs and 
assigns involved to run it intelligently and honestly but intelligence and honesty were of little 
value in this instance without great critical judgment this he had not the house had 
become filled with editors readers critics foremen of manufacturing and printing departments business managers art 
directors traveling salesmen and so on without end each of whom might be reasonably efficient 
if left alone but none of whom worked well together and all of whom used 
up a great deal of money the principal literary publication a magazine of great prestige 
was in the hands of an old man who had been editor for nearly forty 
years a weekly was being run by a boy comparatively a youth of twentynine a 
second magazine devoted to adventure fiction was in the hands of another young man of 
twentysix a national critical monthly was in the hands of salaried critics of great repute 
and uncompromising attitude the book department was divided into the hands of a juvenile editor 
a fiction editor a scientific and educational editor and so on it was mr davis' 
task to see that competent overseers were in charge of all departments so that they 
might flourish and work harmoniously under him but he was neither sufficiently wise or forceful 
to fill the rôle he was old and was veered about first by one theory 
and then by another and within the house were rings and cliques one of the 
most influential of thesethe most influential in factwas one which was captained and led by 
florence j white an irishamerican who as business manager and really more than that general 
manager under davis was in charge of the manufacturing and printing departments and who because 
of his immense budgets for paper ink printing mailing and distribution generally was in practical 
control of the business he it was who with davis' approval said how much was 
to be paid for paper ink composition press work and salaries generally he it was 
who through his henchman the head of the printing department arranged the working schedules by 
which the magazines and books were to reach the presses with the practical power to 
say whether they were to be on time or not he it was who through 
another superintendent supervised the mailing and the stock room and by reason of his great 
executive ability was coming to have a threatening control over the advertising and circulation departments 
the one trouble with white and this was something which would affect any man who 
should come in through davis' auspices was that he knew nothing of art literature or 
science and cared less his only interest being in manufacture he had risen so rapidly 
on the executive side that his power had outrun his financial means davis the present 
head above him had no means beyond his own depreciated share because of poor editorial 
judgment the books and magazines were tottering through a serious loss of prestige to eventual 
failure something had to be done for at that time the expenditure for three years 
past had been much greater than the receipts so marshall p colfax the father of 
hiram colfax had been appealed to because of his interest in reform ideas which might 
be to a certain extent looked upon as related to literature and because he was 
reported to be a man of great wealth rumor reported his fortune as being anywhere 
between six and eight millions the proposition which davis had to put before him was 
this: that he buy from the various heirs and assigns the whole of the stock 
outside his davis' own which amounted to somewhere about sixtyfive per cent and then come 
in as managing director and reorganize the company to suit himself davis was old he 
did not want to trouble himself about the future of this company or risk his 
own independent property he realized as well as anyone that what the company needed was 
new blood a receivership at this juncture would injure the value of the house imprint 
very much indeed white had no money and besides he was so new and different 
that davis scarcely understood what his ambitions or his true importance might be there was 
no real intellectual sympathy between them in the main he did not like white's temperament 
and so in considering what might be done for the company he passed him by 
various consultations were held colfax was greatly flattered to think that this proposition should be 
brought to his attention at all he had three sons only one of whom was 
interested in the soap business edward and hiram the two youngest wanted nothing to do 
with it he thought this might be an outlet for the energies of one or 
both of them preferably hiram who was more of an intellectual and scientific turn than 
the others though his chief interests were financial and besides these books and publications would 
give him the opportunity which he had long been seeking his personal prestige might be 
immensely heightened thereby he examined carefully into the financial phases of the situation using his 
son hiram whose financial judgment he had faith in as an accountant and mouthpiece and 
finally after seeing that he could secure the stock on a longtime consideration for a 
very moderate valuation while it was worth he had his son hiram elected director and 
president and proceeded to see what could be done with the company in this approaching 
transaction florence j white had seen his opportunity and seized it he had realized on 
sight that hiram would need and possibly appreciate all the information and assistance he could 
get and being in a position to know he had laid all the facts in 
connection with the house plainly before him he saw clearly where the trouble lay the 
warring factions the lack of editorial judgment the poor financial manipulations he knew exactly where 
the stock was and by what representations it could be best frightened and made to 
release itself cheaply he worked vigorously for hiram because he liked him and the latter 
reciprocated his regard you've been a prince in this transaction white he said to that 
individual one day you've put things practically in my hands i'm not going to forget 
it don't mention it said white it's to my interest to see a real live 
man come in here when i become president you become vicepresident and that means twentyfive 
thousand a year white was then getting twelve when i become vicepresident nothing will ever 
happen to your interests returned the other man grimly white was six feet tall lean 
savage only semiarticulate colfax was small wiry excitable with enough energy to explode a cartridge 
by yelling at it he was eager vainglorious in many respects brilliant he wanted to 
shine in the world and he did not know how to do it as yet 
exactly the two shook hands firmly some three months later colfax was duly elected director 
and president and the same meeting that elected him president elected florence j white vicepresident 
the latter was for clearing out all the old elements and letting in new blood 
colfax was for going slow until he could see for himself what he wanted to 
do one or two men were eliminated at once an old circulation man and an 
old advertising man in six months while they were still contemplating additional changes and looking 
for new men colfax senior died and the swintonscudderdavis company or at least mr colfax's 
control of it was willed to hiram so he sat there accidentally president and in 
full charge wondering how he should make it a great success and florence j white 
was his henchman and sworn ally at the time that colfax first heard of eugene 
he had been in charge of the swintonscudderdavis company which he was planning to reincorporate 
as the united magazines corporation for three years he had made a number of changes 
some radical some conservative he had put in an advertising man whom he was now 
finding unsatisfactory and had made changes in the art and editorial departments which were more 
the result of the suggestions of others principally of white than the thoughts of his 
own brain martin w davis had retired he was old and sick and unwilling to 
ruminate in a backroom position such men as the editor of the national review swinton's 
magazine and scudder's weekly were the only figures of importance about the place and they 
were now of course immensely subsidiary to hiram colfax and florence white the latter had 
introduced a rather hard bitter atmosphere into the place he had been raised under difficult 
conditions himself in a back street in brooklyn and had no sympathy with the airs 
and intellectual insipidities which characterized the editorial and literary element which filled the place he 
had an irishman's love of organization and politics but far and away above that he 
had an irishman's love of power because of the trick he had scored in winning 
the favor of hiram colfax at the time when the tremendous affairs of the concern 
were in a state of transition he had become immensely ambitious he wanted to be 
not nominally but actually director of the affairs of this house under colfax and he 
saw his way clear to do it by getting editors art directors department heads and 
assistants generally who were agreeable to him but unfortunately he could not do this directly 
for while colfax cared little about the details of the business his hobby was just 
this one thingmen like obadiah kalvin of the kalvin publishing company who by the way 
was now his one great rival colfax prided himself on his ability to select men 
his general idea was that if he could find one more man as good as 
florence white to take charge of the art editorial and book end of the business 
not from the manufacturing and commercial but from the intellectual and spiritual endsa man with 
ideas who would draw to him authors editors scientific writers and capable assistants generallythe fortune 
of the house would be made he thought sanely enough from some points of view 
that this publishing world could be divided in this way white bringing the inside manufacturing 
purchasing and selling interests to a state of perfection the new man whoever he might 
be bringing the ideas of the house and their literary and artistic representation up to 
such a state of efficiency that the whole country would know that it was once 
more powerful and successful he wanted to be called the foremost publisher of his day 
and then he could retire gracefully or devote himself to other financial matters as he 
pleased he really did not understand florence j white as well as he did himself 
white was a past master at dissembling he had no desire to see any such 
thing as colfax was now planning come to pass he could not do the things 
intellectually and spiritually which colfax wanted done nevertheless he wanted to be king under this 
emperor the real power behind the throne and he did not propose to brook any 
interference if he could help it it was in his power having the printing and 
composing room in his hands to cause any man whom he greatly disliked to suffer 
severely forms could be delayed material lost complaints lodged as to dilatoriness in the matter 
of meeting schedules and so on ad infinitum he had the irishman's love of chicanery 
in the matter of morals if he could get at an enemy's record and there 
was a flaw in it the facts were apt to become mysteriously known at the 
most inconvenient times he demanded the utmost loyalty of those who worked under him if 
a man did not know enough instinctively to work intelligently for his interests while at 
the same time appearing to serve the interests of the house at large only he 
was soon dismissed on one pretext or another intelligent department heads not sure of their 
own strength and seeing which way the wind was blowing soon lined up in his 
course those whom he liked and who did his will prospered those whom he disliked 
suffered greatly in their duties and were forever explaining or complaining to colfax who was 
not aware of white's subtlety and who therefore thought them incompetent colfax when he first 
heard of eugene was still cherishing his dream of a literary and artistic primate who 
should rank in power with white he had not found him as yet for all 
the men he sincerely admired and thought fitted for the position were in business for 
themselves he had sounded one man after another but to no satisfactory end then it 
became necessary to fill the position of advertising manager with someone who would make a 
conspicuous success of it and he began to sound various authorities naturally he looked at 
the different advertising men working for various publications and quickly came to the name of 
eugene witla the latter was rumored to be making a shining success of his work 
he was well liked where he was two different business men told colfax that they 
had met him and that he was exceptionally clever a third told him of his 
record with summerfield and through a fourth man who knew eugene and who was having 
him to lunch at the hardware club a few weeks later colfax had a chance 
to meet him without appearing to be interested in him in any way not knowing 
who colfax was or rather very little other than that he was president of this 
great rival publishing concern eugene was perfectly free and easy in his manner he was 
never affected at any time decidedly eager to learn things from anybody and supremely good 
natured so you're swinton scudder and davis are you he said to colfax on introduction 
that trinity must have shrunk some to get condensed into you but i suppose the 
power is all there i don't know about that i don't know about that exclaimed 
colfax electrically he was always ready like a greyhound to run another a race they 
tell me swinton and scudder were exceptionally big men if you have as much force 
as you have length there's nothing the matter with you though oh i'm all right 
said eugene when i'm by myself these little men worry me though they are so 
darned smart colfax cackled ecstatically he liked eugene's looks the latter's manner easy and not 
in any way nervous or irritable but coupled with a heavenly alertness of eye took 
his fancy it was a fit companion for his own terrific energy and it was 
not unduly soft or yielding so you're the advertising manager of the north american how'd 
they ever come to tie you down to that they didn't tie me said eugene 
i just lay down but they put a nice fat salary on top of me 
to keep me there i wouldn't lie down for anything except a salary he grinned 
smartly colfax cackled well my boy it doesn't seem to be hurting your ribs does 
it they've not caved in yet ha haha ha they've not have they ha ha 
eugene studied this little man with great interest he was taken by his sharp fierce 
examining eye he was so different from kalvin who was about his size but so 
much more quiet peaceful dignified colfax was electric noisy insistent like a pert jackinthebox he 
seemed to be nothing but energy eugene thought of him as having an electric body 
coated over with some thin veneer of skin he seemed as direct as a flash 
of lightning doing pretty good over there are you he asked i've heard a little 
something about you from time to time not much not much just a little not 
unfavorable though not unfavorable i hope not said eugene easily he wondered why colfax was 
so interested in him the latter kept looking him over much as one might examine 
a prize animal their eyes would meet and colfax's would gleam with a savage but 
friendly fire well said eugene to him finally i'm just thinking my boy i'm just 
thinking he returned and that was all eugene could get out of him it was 
not long after this very peculiar meeting which stuck in eugene's memory that colfax invited 
him over to his house in new york to dinner i wish he wrote one 
day not long after this meeting that the next time you are in new york 
you would let me know i would like to have you come to my house 
to dine you and i ought to be pretty good friends there are a number 
of things i would like to talk to you about this was written on the 
paper of the united magazines corporation which had just been organized to take over the 
old company of swinton scudder and davis and was labeled the office of the president 
eugene thought this was significant could colfax be going to make him an offer of 
some kind well the more the merrier he was doing very well indeed and liked 
mr kalvin very much in fact all his surroundings but as an offer was a 
testimonial to merit and could be shown as such he would not be opposed to 
receiving it it might strengthen him with kalvin if it did nothing else he made 
an occasion to go over first talking the letter over with angela who was simply 
curious about the whole thing he told her how much interested colfax appeared to be 
the first time they met and that he fancied it might mean an offer from 
the united magazines corporation at some time or other i'm not particularly anxious about it 
said eugene but i'd like to see what is there angela was not sure that 
it was wise to bother with it it's a big firm she said but it 
isn't bigger than mr kalvin's and he's been mighty nice to you you'd better not 
do anything to injure yourself with him eugene thought of this it was sound advice 
still he wanted to hear i won't do anything he said i would like to 
hear what he has to say though a little later he wrote that he was 
coming on the twentieth and that he would be glad to take dinner with colfax 
the first meeting between eugene and colfax had been conclusive so far as future friendship 
was concerned these two like eugene and summerfield were temperamentally in accord though colfax was 
very much superior to summerfield in his ability to command men this night when they 
met at dinner at colfax's house the latter was most cordial colfax had invited him 
to come to his office and together they went uptown in his automobile his residence 
was in upper fifth avenue a new white marble fronted building with great iron gates 
at the door and a splendid entry set with small palms and dwarf cedars eugene 
saw at once that this man was living in that intense atmosphere of commercial and 
financial rivalry which makes living in new york so keen you could feel the air 
of hard cold order about the place the insistence on perfection of appointment the compulsion 
toward material display which was held in check only by that sense of fitness which 
knowledge of current taste and the mode in everything demanded his automobile was very large 
and very new the latest model a great dark blue affair which ran as silently 
as a sewing machine the footman who opened the door was six feet tall dressed 
in knee breeches and a swallowtailed coat the valet was a japanese silent polite attentive 
eugene was introduced to mrs colfax a most graceful but somewhat selfconscious woman a french 
maid later presented two children a boy and a girl eugene by now had become 
used to luxury in various forms and this house was not superior to many he 
had seen but it ranked with the best colfax was most free in it he 
threw his overcoat to the valet carelessly and tossed his babies in the air by 
turn when they were presented to him by the french maid his wife slightly taller 
than himself received a resounding smack there ceta he exclaimed a diminutive for cecile as 
eugene subsequently learned how do you like that eh meet mr witla he's an artist 
and an art director and an advertising manager and a most humble person put in 
eugene smilingly not half as bad as you may think his report is greatly exaggerated 
mrs colfax smiled sweetly i discount much that he says at once she returned more 
later won't you come up into the library they ascended together jesting eugene was pleased 
with what he saw mrs colfax liked him she excused herself after a little while 
and colfax talked life in general i'm going to show you my house now and 
after dinner i'm going to talk a little business to you you interest me i 
may as well tell you that well you interest me colfax said eugene genially i 
like you you don't like me any more than i like you that's a sure 
thing replied the other chapter xxxix the results of this evening were most pleasant but 
in some ways disconcerting it became perfectly plain that colfax was anxious to have eugene 
desert the kalvin company and come over to him you people over there he said 
to him at one stage of the conversation have an excellent company but it doesn't 
compare with this organization which we are revising why what are your two publications to 
our seven you have one eminently successful onethe one you're onand no book business whatsoever 
we have seven publications all doing excellently well and a book business that is second 
to none in the country you know that if it hadn't been that the business 
had been horribly mismanaged it would never have come into my hands at all why 
witla i want to tell you one little fact in connection with that organization which 
will illustrate everything else which might be said in connection with it before i came 
here they were wasting twenty thousand dollars a year on ink alone we were publishing 
a hundred absolutely useless books that did not sell enough to pay for the cost 
of printing let alone the paper plates typework and cost of distribution i think it's 
safe to say we lost over a hundred thousand dollars a year that way the 
magazines were running down they haven't waked up sufficiently yet to suit me but i'm 
looking for men i'm really looking for one man eventually who will take charge of 
all that editorial and art work and make it into something exceptional he wants to 
be a man who can handle men if i can get the right man i 
will even include the advertising department for that really belongs with the literary and art 
sections it depends on the man he looked significantly at eugene who sat there stroking 
his upper lip with his hand well he said thoughtfully that ought to make a 
very nice place for someone who have you in mind no one as yet that 
i'm absolutely sure of i have one man in mind who i think might come 
to fill the position after he had had a look about the organization and a 
chance to study its needs a little it's a hard position to hold it requires 
a man with imagination tact judgment he would have to be a sort of vicecolfax 
for i can't give my attention permanently to that business i don't want to i 
have bigger fish to fry but i want someone who will eventually be my other 
self in these departments who can get along with florence white and the men under 
him and hold his own in his own world i want a sort of bipartisan 
commission down thereeach man supreme in his own realm it sounds interesting said eugene thoughtfully 
who's your man as i say he isn't quite ready yet in my judgment but 
he is near it and he's the right man he's in this room now you're 
the man i'm thinking about witla no said eugene quietly yes you replied colfax you 
flatter me he said with a deprecatory wave of his hand i'm not so sure 
that he is oh yes he is if he thinks he is replied colfax emphatically 
opportunity doesn't knock in vain at a real man's door at least i don't believe 
it will knock here and not be admitted why the advertising department of this business 
alone is worth eighteen thousand dollars a year to begin with eugene sat up he 
was getting twelve could he afford to ignore that offer could the kalvin company afford 
to pay him that much they were paying him pretty well as it was could 
the kalvin company offer him the prospects which this company was offering him what is 
more i might say went on colfax the general publishing control of this organizationthe position 
of managing publisher which i am going to create and which when you are fitted 
for it you can have will be worth twentyfive thousand dollars a year and that 
oughtn't to be so very far away either eugene turned that over in his mind 
without saying anything this offer coming so emphatically and definitely at this time actually made 
him nervous and fearsome it was such a tremendous thing to talk aboutthe literary art 
and advertising control of the united magazines corporation who was this man white what was 
he like would he be able to agree with him this man beside him was 
so hard so brilliant so dynamic he would expect so much and then his work 
with townsend miller and under mr kalvin how much he had learned of the editorial 
game by merely talking and planning with those two men he had got the whole 
idea of timely topics of big progressive national forecasts and features of odd departments and 
interesting pieces of fiction and personality studies from talking with miller alone kalvin had made 
clear to him what constituted great craftsmen of course long before he had suspected just 
how it was but in philadelphia he had sat in conference with miller and kalvin 
and knew he had practically managed the former's little art department for him without paying 
much attention to it either couldn't he really handle this greater thing if he tried 
if he didn't someone else would would the man who would be so much greater 
than himself i'm not anxious that you should act hastily said colfax soothingly after a 
little bit for he saw that eugene was debating the question solemnly and that it 
was a severe problem for him i know how you feel you have gone into 
the kalvin company and you've made good they've been nice to you it's only natural 
that they should be you hate to leave well think it over i won't tempt 
you beyond your best judgment think it over there's a splendid chance here just the 
same i like you and i think you are the man to get away with 
it come down to my place tomorrow and let me show you what we have 
i want to show our resources i don't think you know how big this thing 
really is yes i do replied eugene smiling it certainly is a fascinating proposition but 
i can't make up my mind about it now it's something i want to think 
about i'd like to take my time and i'll let you know take all the 
time you want my boy take all the time you want exclaimed colfax i'll wait 
for you a little while i'm in no lifeordeath hurry this position can't be filled 
satisfactorily in a minute when you're ready let me know what you decide and now 
let's go to the theatrewhat do you say the automobile was called mrs colfax and 
her guest miss genier appeared there was an interesting evening in a box with eugene 
talking gaily and entertainingly to all and then an aftertheatre bite at sherry's the next 
morning for he stayed all night at colfax's they visited the united magazines corporation building 
together and at noon eugene returned to philadelphia his head was fairly seething and ringing 
with all he had seen and heard colfax was a great man he thought greater 
in some respects than kalvin he was more forceful more enthusiastic youngermore like himself than 
kalvin he could never fail he was too rich he would make a success of 
this great corporationa tremendous successand if he went he might help make it with him 
what a thing that would be very different from working for a corporation with whose 
success he had never had anything to do should he ignore this offer new york 
a true art and literary standing a great executive and social standing fame moneyall these 
were calling why on eighteen or twentyfive thousand he could have a splendid studio apartment 
of his own say on riverside drive he could entertain magnificently he could keep an 
automobile without worrying about it angela would cease feeling that they had to be careful 
it would be the apex of lieutenantship for him beyond that he would take stock 
in the company or a business of his own what a long distance he had 
come from the days when here as a boy he had walked the streets wondering 
where he would find a room and when as an art failure he carried his 
paintings about and sold them for ten and fifteen dollars dear heaven what peculiar tricks 
fortune could play the discussion with angela of this proposition led to some additional uncertainty 
for although she was greatly impressed with what colfax offered she was afraid eugene might 
be making a mistake in leaving kalvin the latter had been so nice to eugene 
he had never associated with him in any intimate way but he and angela had 
been invited to his home on several formal occasions and eugene had reported that kalvin 
was constantly giving him good advice his attitude in the office was not critical but 
analytic and considerate he's been mighty nice to me eugene said to her one morning 
at breakfast they all have it's a shame to leave him and yet now that 
i look at it i can see very plainly that there is never going to 
be the field here that there will be with the united company they have the 
publications and the book business and the kalvin company hasn't and won't have kalvin is 
too old they're in new york too that's one thing i like about it i'd 
like to live in new york again wouldn't you it would be fine said angela 
who had never really cared for philadelphia and who saw visions of tremendous superiority in 
this situation philadelphia had always seemed a little out of the way of things after 
new york and paris only eugene's good salary and the comforts they had experienced here 
had made it tolerable why don't you speak to mr kalvin and tell him just 
what mr colfax says she asked it may be that he'll offer to raise your 
salary so much that you'll want to stay when he hears of this no danger 
replied eugene he may raise it a bit but he never can pay me twentyfive 
thousand dollars a year there isn't any reason for paying it it takes a corporation 
like the united to do it there isn't a man in our place gets that 
unless it is fredericks besides i could never be anything more here or much more 
than advertising manager miller has that editorial job sewed up he ought to have it 
too he's a good man this thing that colfax offers lets me out into a 
new field i don't want to be an advertising manager all my days if i 
can help it i don't want you to be either eugene sighed angela it's a 
shame you can't quit entirely and take up your art work i've always thought that 
if you were to stop now and go to painting you would make a success 
of it there's nothing the matter with your nerves now it's just a question of 
whether we want to live more simply for a while and let you work at 
that i'm sure you'd make a big success of it art doesn't appeal to me 
so much as it did once replied eugene i've lived too well and i know 
a lot more about living than i once did where could i make twelve thousand 
a year painting if i had a hundred thousand or a couple of hundred thousand 
laid aside it would be a different thing but i haven't all we have is 
that pennsylvania railroad stock and those lots in montclair eating their merry little heads off 
in taxes and that steel common stock if we go back to new york we 
ought to build on that montclair property and rent it if we don't want to 
live in it if i quit now we wouldn't have more than two thousand dollars 
a year outside of what i could earn and what sort of a life can 
you live on that angela saw disappearing under those circumstances the rather pleasant world of 
entertainment in which they were disporting themselves art distinction might be delightful but would it 
furnish such a table as they were sitting at this morning would they have as 
nice a home and as many friends art was glorious but would they have as 
many rides and auto trips as they had now would she be able to dress 
as nicely it took money to produce a variety of clothinghouse street evening morning and 
other wear hats at thirtyfive and forty dollars were not in the range of artists' 
wives as a rule did she want to go back to a simpler life for 
his art's sake wouldn't it be better to have him go with mr colfax and 
make a year for a while and then have him retire you'd better talk to 
mr kalvin she counseled you'll have to do that anyhow see what he says after 
that you can decide what you must do eugene hesitated but after thinking it all 
over he decided that he would one morning not long after when he met mr 
kalvin in the main hall on the editorial floor he said i'd like to talk 
to you for a few moments some time today alone mr kalvin if you can 
spare me the time certainly i'm not busy now returned the president come right down 
what is it you want to see me about well i'll tell you said eugene 
when they had reached the former's office and he had closed the door i've had 
an offer that i feel that i ought to talk to you about it's a 
pretty fascinating proposition and it's troubling me i owe it to you as well as 
to myself to speak about it yes what is it said kalvin considerately mr colfax 
of the united magazines corporation came to me not long ago and wanted to know 
if i would not come with him he offers me eighteen thousand dollars a year 
as advertising manager to begin with and a chance to take charge of all the 
art and editorial ends as well a little later at twentyfive thousand dollars he calls 
it the managingpublishing end of the business i've been thinking of it seriously for i've 
handled the art and advertising ends here and at the summerfield company and i have 
always imagined that i knew something of the book and magazine business i know it's 
a rather large proposition but i'm not at all sure that i couldn't handle it 
mr kalvin listened quietly he saw what colfax's scheme was and liked it as a 
proposition it was a good idea but needed an exceptional man for the position was 
eugene the man he wasn't sure of that and yet perchance he might be colfax 
he thought was a man of excellent financial if not publishing judgment he might if 
he could get the proper person make an excellent success of his business eugene interested 
him perhaps more at first flash than he would later this man before him had 
a most promising appearance he was clean quick with an alert mind and eye he 
could see how because of eugene's success here colfax was thinking of him being even 
more exceptional than he was he was a good man a fine man under direction 
would colfax have the patience the interest the sympathy to work with and understand him 
now let's think about that a little witla he said quietly it's a flattering offer 
you'd be foolish if you didn't give it careful consideration do you know anything about 
the organization of that place over there no replied eugene nothing except what i learned 
by casually going over it with mr colfax do you know much about colfax as 
a man very little i've only met him twice he's forceful dramatic a man with 
lots of ideas i understand he's very rich three or four millions someone told me 
kalvin's hand moved indifferently do you like him well i can't say yet absolutely whether 
i do or don't he interests me a lot he's wonderfully dynamic i'm sure i'm 
favorably impressed with him and he wants to give you charge eventually of all the 
magazines and books the publishing end so he says said eugene i'd go a little 
slow if i were saddling myself with that responsibility i'd want to be sure that 
i knew all about it you want to remember witla that running one department under 
the direction and with the sympathetic assistance and consideration of someone over you is very 
different from running four or five departments on your own responsibility and with no one 
over you except someone who wants intelligent guidance from you colfax as i understand him 
isn't a publisher either by tendency or training or education he's a financier he'll want 
you if you take that position to tell him how it shall be done now 
unless you know a great deal about the publishing business you have a difficult task 
in that i don't want to appear to be throwing cold water on your natural 
ambition to get up in the world you're entitled to go higher if you can 
no one in your circle of acquaintances would wish you more luck than i will 
if you decide to go i want you to think carefully of what you are 
doing where you are here you are perfectly safe or as nearly safe as any 
man is who behaves himself and maintains his natural force and energy can be it's 
only natural that you should expect more money in the face of this offer and 
i shall be perfectly willing to give it to you i intended as you possibly 
expected to do somewhat better for you by january i'll say now that if you 
want to stay here you can have fourteen thousand now and possibly sixteen thousand in 
a year or a year and a half from now i don't want to overload 
this department with what i consider an undue salary i think sixteen thousand dollars when 
it is paid will be high for the work that is done here but you're 
a good man and i'm perfectly willing to pay it to you the thing for 
you to do is to make up your mind whether this proposition which i now 
make you is safer and more in accord with your desires than the one mr 
colfax makes you with him your eighteen thousand begins at once with me sixteen thousand 
is a year away anyhow with him you have promise of an outlook which is 
much more glittering than any you can reasonably hope for here but you want to 
remember that the difficulties will be of course proportionately greater you know something about me 
by now you stilland don't think i want to do him any injustice i don'thave 
to learn about mr colfax now i'd advise you to think carefully before you act 
study the situation over there before you accept it the united magazines corporation is a 
great concern i have no doubt that under mr colfax's management it has a brilliant 
future in store for it he is an able man if you finally decide to 
go come and tell me and there will be no hard feelings one way or 
the other if you decide to stay the new salary arrangement goes into effect at 
once as a matter of fact i might as well have mr fredericks credit that 
up to you so that you can say that you have drawn that sum here 
it won't do you any harm then we can run along as before i know 
it isn't good business as a rule to try and keep a man who has 
been poisoned by a bigger offer and because i know that is the reason why 
i am only offering you fourteen thousand dollars this year i want to be sure 
that you are sure that you want to stay see he smiled eugene arose i 
see he said you are one of the best men i have ever known mr 
kalvin you have constantly treated me with more consideration than i ever expected to receive 
anywhere it has been a pleasure and a privilege to work for you if i 
stay it will be because i want to because i value your friendship well said 
kalvin quietly that's very nice i'm sure and i appreciate it but don't let your 
friendship for me or your sense of gratitude stop you from doing something you think 
you ought to do go ahead if you feel like it i won't feel the 
least bit angry with you i'll feel sorry but that's neither here nor there life 
is a constant condition of readjustment and every good business man knows it he took 
eugene's extended hand good luck he said whatever you dohis favorite expression chapter xl the 
upshot of eugene's final speculation was that he accepted the offer of the united magazines 
corporation and left mr kalvin colfax had written one day to his house asking him 
what he thought he would do about it the more he had turned it over 
in his mind the more it had grown in attraction the colfax company was erecting 
a tremendous building eighteen stories high in the heart of the middle business district in 
new york near union square to house all their departments colfax had said at the 
time eugene took dinner with him that the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth floors would be 
devoted to the editorial publication circulation art and advertising departments he had asked eugene what 
he had thought would be a good floor arrangement and the latter with his usual 
facility for scheming such things had scratched on a piece of paper a tentative layout 
for the various departments he had put the editorial and art departments on the topmost 
floor giving the publisher whoever he might eventually prove to be a commanding position in 
a central room on the western side of the building which overlooked all the city 
between the square and hudson river and showed that magnificent body of water as a 
panorama for the eye to feast upon he had put the advertising and some overflow 
editorial rooms on the seventeenth floor and the circulation with its attendant mailing and cabinet 
record rooms on the sixteenth the publisher's and editor's rooms he laid out after an 
old flemish scheme he had long had in mind in which green dark blue bloodred 
and black walnut shades contrasted richly with the flood of light which would be available 
you might as well do this thing right if you do it at all he 
had said to colfax nearly all the editorial offices i have ever seen have been 
the flimsiest makeshifts a richlooking editorial art and advertising department would help your company a 
great deal it has advertising value he recalled as he spoke summerfield's theory that a 
look of prosperity was about the most valuable asset a house could have colfax agreed 
with him and said when the time came that he wished eugene would do him 
the favor to come and look the thing over i have two good architects on 
the job he explained but i would rather trust your ideas as to how those 
rooms should be laid out when he was considering this final call for a decision 
he was thinking how this floor would lookhow rich it would be eventually if he 
succeeded his office would be the most sumptuous thing in it he would be the 
most conspicuous figure in the great new building apart from colfax himself thoughts of this 
kind which ought to have had but very little share in any commercial speculation were 
nevertheless uppermost in eugene's mind for he was not a business manhe was primarily an 
artist and for all his floundering round in the commercial world he remained an artist 
still his sense of his coming dignity and standing before the world was almost greater 
than his sense of the terrifying responsibility which it involved colfax was a hard man 
he knew harder even than summerfield for he talked less and acted more but this 
did not sink into eugene's consciousness sufficiently to worry him he fancied he was a 
strong man able to hold his own anywhere angela was really not very much opposed 
to the change though her natural conservatism made her worry and hesitate to approve it 
was a great step forward if eugene succeeded but if he failed it would be 
such a loss colfax has so much faith in me he told her he's convinced 
that i can do it and faith like that is a great help i'd like 
to try it anyhow it can't do me any harm if i think i can't 
handle the publishing proposition i'll stick to the advertising end all right said angela but 
i scarcely know what to advise they've been so nice to you over here i'll 
try it said eugene determinedly nothing venture nothing have and he informed kalvin the same 
day the latter looked at him solemnly his keen gray eyes contemplating the situation from 
all points of view well eugene he said you're shouldering a great responsibility it's difficult 
think carefully of everything that you do i'm sorry to see you go goodbye he 
had the feeling that eugene was making a mistakethat he would do better to rest 
a while where he was but persuasion was useless it would only give eugene the 
notion that he was more important than he wasmake matters more difficult in the future 
kalvin had heard a number of things concerning colfax recently and he fancied that eugene 
might find it hard to deal with him later the general impression was that he 
was subject to sudden likes and dislikes which did not bear the test of time 
he was said to be scarcely human enough to be the effective head of a 
great working corporation the truth was that this general opinion was quite correct colfax was 
as hard as steel but of a smiling and delightful presence to those he fancied 
vanity was really his other name and ambition with him knew no bounds he hoped 
to make a tremendous success of his life to be looked up to as an 
imposing financier and he wanted menonly strong men about him eugene seemed to colfax to 
be a strong man and the day he finally communicated with him saying that he 
thought that he would accept his offer but that he wished to talk to him 
further colfax threw his hat up in the air slapped his side partner white on 
the back and exclaimed: whee florrie there's a trick i've scored for this corporation there's 
a man unless i am greatly mistaken will do something here he's young but he's 
all right he's got the looks on you and me florrie but we can stand 
that can't we white eyed him with a show of joy and satisfaction which was 
purely simulated he had seen many editors and many advertising men in his time to 
his judgment they were nearly all lightweights men who were easily satisfied with the little 
toy wherewith he or anyone might decide to gratify their vanity this was probably another 
case in point but if a real publisher were coming in here it would not 
be so well with him he might attempt to crowd in on his authority or 
at least divide it with him that did not appeal to his personal vanity it 
really put a stumbling block in his path for he hoped to rule here some 
day alone why was it that colfax was so eager to have the authority in 
this house divided was it because he was somewhat afraid of him he thought so 
and he was exceedingly close to the truth when he thought so florrie's a good 
lieutenant colfax said to himself but he needs to be counterbalanced here by someone who 
will represent the refinements and that intellectual superiority which the world respects he wanted this 
refinement and intellectual superiority to be popular with the public and to produce results in 
the shape of increased circulation for his magazines and books these two would then act 
as checks each to the other thus preventing the house from becoming overweighted in either 
direction then he could drive this team as a grand masterthe man who had selected 
both whose ideas they represented and whose judgment they respected the world of finance and 
trade would know they were nothing without him what eugene thought and what white thought 
of this prospective situation was that the other would naturally be the minor figure and 
that he under colfax would be the shining light eugene was convinced that the house 
without proper artistic and intellectual dominance was nothing white was convinced that without sane commercial 
management it was a failure and that this was the thing to look to money 
could buy brains colfax introduced eugene to white on the morning he arrived to take 
charge for on the previous occasions when he had been there white was absent the 
two looked at each other and immediately suspended judgment for both were able men eugene 
saw white as an interesting typetall leathery swaggering a backstreet bully evolved into the semblance 
of a gentleman white saw in eugene a nervous refined semiemotional literary and artistic type 
who had however a curious versatility and virility not common among those whom he had 
previously encountered he was exceedingly forceful but not poised that he could eventually undermine him 
if he could not dominate him he did not doubt still he was coming in 
with the backing of colfax and a great reputation and it might not be easy 
eugene made him feel nervous he wondered as he looked at him whether colfax would 
really make him general literary artistic and advertising administrator or whether he would remain simply 
advertising manager as he now entered colfax had not accepted eugene for more than that 
here he is florrie colfax had said of eugene in introducing him to white this 
is the man i've been talking about witlamr white whitemr witla you two want to 
get together for the good of this house in the future what do you think 
of each other eugene had previously noted the peculiarity of this rowdy rah rah attitude 
on the part of colfax he seemed to have no sense of the conventions of 
social address and conference at any time now by god colfax exclaimed striking his right 
fist against his left palm unless i am greatly mistaken this house is going to 
begin to move i'm not positive that i have the man i want but i 
think i have white let's stroll around and introduce him white swaggered to the office 
door sure he said quietly an exceptional man he said to himself colfax was almost 
beside himself with satisfaction for he was subject to emotional flushes which however related to 
selfaggrandizement only he walked with a great stride little as he was which was his 
wont when he was feeling particularly satisfied he talked in a loud voice for he 
wanted everyone to know that he hiram colfax was about and as forceful as the 
lord of so great an institution should be he could yell and scream something like 
a woman in a paroxysm of rage when he was thwarted or irritated eugene did 
not know that as yet here's one of the printing floors he said to eugene 
throwing open a door which revealed a room full of thundering presses of giant size 
where's dodson boy where's dodson tell him to come here he's foreman of our printing 
department he added turning to eugene as the printer's devil who had been working at 
a press scurried away to find his master i told you i guess that we 
have thirty of these presses there are four more floors just like this so you 
did replied eugene it certainly is a great concern i can see that the possibilities 
of a thing like this are almost limitless limitlessi should say it depends on what 
you can do with this and he tapped eugene's forehead if you do your part 
right and he does histurning to whitethere won't be any limit to what this house 
can do that remains to be seen just then dodson came bustling up a shrewd 
keen henchman of white's and looked at eugene curiously dodson mr witla the new advertising 
manager he's going to try to help pay for all this wasteful presswork you're doing 
witla mr dodson manager of the printing department the two men shook hands eugene felt 
in a way as though he were talking to an underling and did not pay 
very definite attention to him dodson resented his attitude somewhat but gave no sign his 
loyalty was to white and he felt himself perfectly safe under that man's supervision the 
next visit was to the composing room where a vast army of men were working 
away at type racks and linotype machines a short fat inkstreaked foreman in a green 
striped apron that looked as though it might have been made of bed ticking came 
forward to greet them ingratiatingly he was plainly nervous at their presence and withdrew his 
hand when eugene offered to take it it's too dirty he said i'll take the 
will for the deed mr witla more explanations and laudations of the extent of the 
business followed then came the circulation department with its head a tall dark man who 
looked solemnly at eugene uncertain as to what place he was to have in the 
organization and uncertain as to what attitude he should ultimately have to take white was 
butting into his affairs as he told his wife and he did not know where 
it would end he had heard rumors to the effect that there was to be 
a new man soon who was to have great authority over various departments was this 
he there came next the editors of the various magazines who viewed this triumphal procession 
with more or less contempt for to them both colfax and white were raw uncouth 
upstarts blazoning their material superiority in loudmouthed phrases colfax talked too loud and was too 
vainglorious white was too hard bitter and unreasoning they hated them both with a secret 
hate but there was no escaping their domination the need of living salaries held all 
in obsequious subjection here's mr marchwood colfax said inconsiderately of the editor of the international 
review he thinks he's making a wonderful publication of that but we don't know whether 
he is yet or not eugene winced for marchwood he was so calm so refined 
so professional i suppose we can only go by the circulation department he replied simply 
attracted by eugene's sympathetic smile that's all that's all exclaimed colfax that is probably true 
said eugene but a good thing ought to be as easily circulated as a poor 
one at least it's worth trying mr marchwood smiled it was a bit of intellectual 
kindness in a world of cruel comment it's a great institution said eugene finally on 
reaching the president's office again i'll begin now and see what i can do good 
luck my boy good luck said colfax loudly i'm laying great stress on what you're 
going to do you know don't lean too hard returned eugene remember i'm just one 
in a great organization i know i know but the one is all i need 
up therethe one see yes yes laughed eugene cheer up we'll be able to do 
a little something i'm sure a great man that colfax declared to white as he 
went away the real stuff in that fellow no flinching there you notice he knows 
how to think now florrie unless i miss my guess you and i are going 
to get somewhere with this thing white smiled gloomily almost cynically he was not so 
sure eugene was pretty good but he was obviously too independent too artistic to be 
really stable and dependable he would never run to him for advice but he would 
probably make mistakes he might lose his head what must he do to offset this 
new invasion of authority discredit him certainly but he needn't worry about that eugene would 
do something he would make mistakes of some kind he felt sure of it he 
was almost positive of it chapter xli the opening days of this their second return 
to new york were a period of great joy to angela unlike that first time 
when she was returning after seven months of loneliness and unhappiness to a sick husband 
and a gloomy outlook she was now looking forward to what in spite of her 
previous doubts was a glorious career of dignity prosperity and abundance eugene was such an 
important man now his career was so well marked and in a way almost certified 
they had a good bit of money in the bank their investments in stocks on 
which they obtained a uniform rate of interest of about seven per cent aggregated they 
had two lots two hundred by two hundred in montclair which were said to be 
slowly increasing in value and which eugene now estimated to be worth about six thousand 
he was talking about investing what additional money he might save in stocks bearing better 
interest or some sound commercial venture when the proper time came a little later he 
might even abandon the publishing field entirely and renew his interest in art he was 
certainly getting near the possibility of this the place which they selected for their residence 
in new york was in a new and very sumptuous studio apartment building on riverside 
drive near seventyninth street where eugene had long fancied he would like to live this 
famous thoroughfare and show place with its restricted park atmosphere its magnificent and commanding view 
of the lordly hudson its wondrous woods of color and magnificent sunsets had long taken 
his eye when he had first come to new york it had been his delight 
to stroll here watching the stream of fashionable equipages pour out towards grant's tomb and 
return he had sat on a park bench many an afternoon at this very spot 
or farther up and watched the gay company of horsemen and horsewomen riding cheerfully by 
nodding to their social acquaintances speaking to the park keepers and road scavengers in a 
condescending and superior way taking their leisure in a comfortable fashion and looking idly at 
the river it seemed a wonderful world to him at that time only millionaires could 
afford to live there he thoughtso ignorant was he of the financial tricks of the 
world these handsomely garbed men in riding coats and breeches the chic looking girls in 
stiff black hats trailing black riding skirts yellow gloved and sporting short whips which looked 
more like dainty canes than anything else took his fancy greatly it was his idea 
at that time that this was almost the apex of social gloryto be permitted to 
ride here of an afternoon since then he had come a long way and learned 
a great deal but he still fancied this street as one of the few perfect 
expressions of the elegance and luxury of metropolitan life and he wanted to live on 
it angela was given authority after discussion to see what she could find in the 
way of an apartment of say nine or eleven rooms with two baths or more 
which should not cost more than three thousand or three thousand five hundred as a 
matter of fact a very handsome apartment of nine rooms and two baths including a 
studio room eighteen feet high forty feet long and twentytwo feet wide was found at 
the now to them comparatively moderate sum of three thousand two hundred the chambers were 
beautifully finished in old english oak carved and stained after a very pleasing fifteenth century 
model and the walls were left to the discretion of the incoming tenant whatever was 
desired in the way of tapestries silks or other wall furnishing would be supplied eugene 
chose greenbrown tapestries representing old rhine castles for his studio and blue and brown silks 
for his wall furnishings elsewhere he now realized a long cherished dream of having the 
great wooden cross of brown stained oak ornamented with a figure of the bleeding christ 
which he set in a dark shaded corner behind two immense wax candles set in 
tall heavy bronze candlesticks the size of small bed posts these when lighted in an 
otherwise darkened room and flickering ruefully cast a peculiar spell of beauty over the gay 
throngs which sometimes assembled here a grand piano in old english oak occupied one corner 
a magnificent music cabinet in french burnt woodwork stood near by there were a number 
of carved and fluted high back chairs a carved easel with one of his best 
pictures displayed a black marble pedestal bearing a yellow stained marble bust of nero with 
his lascivious degenerate face scowling grimly at the world and two gold plated candelabra of 
eleven branches each hung upon the north wall two wide tall windows with storm sashes 
which reached from the floor to the ceiling commanded the west view of the hudson 
outside one was a small stone balcony wide enough to accommodate four chairs which gave 
a beautiful cool view of the drive it was shielded by an awning in summer 
and was nine storeys above the ground over the water of the more or less 
peaceful stream were the stacks and outlines of a great factory and in the roadstead 
lay boats always war vessels tramp freighters sail boats and up and down passed the 
endless traffic of small craft always so pleasant to look upon in fair or foul 
weather it was a beautiful apartment beautifully finished in which most of their furniture brought 
from philadelphia fitted admirably it was here that at last they settled down to enjoy 
the fruit of that long struggle and comparative victory which brought them so near their 
much desired goalan indestructible and unchangeable competence which no winds of ill fortune could readily 
destroy eugene was quite beside himself with joy and satisfaction at thus finding himself and 
angela eventually surrounded by those tokens of luxury comfort and distinction which had so long 
haunted his brain most of us go through life with the furniture of our prospective 
castle well outlined in mind but with never the privilege of seeing it realized we 
have our pictures our hangings our servitors well and ably selected eugene's were real at 
last chapter xlii the affairs of the united magazines corporation so far as the advertising 
commercial and manufacturing ends at least were concerned were not in such an unfortunate condition 
by any means as to preclude their being quickly restored by tact good business judgment 
and hard work since the accession to power of florence white in the commercial and 
financial ends things in that quarter at least had slowly begun to take a turn 
for the better although he had no judgment whatsoever as to what constituted a timely 
article an important book or a saleable art feature he had that peculiar intuition for 
right methods of manufacture right buying and right selling of stock right handling of labor 
from the cost and efficiency point of view which made him a power to be 
reckoned with he knew a good manufacturing man to employ at sight he knew where 
books could be sold and how he knew how to buy paper in large quantities 
and at the cheapest rates and how to print and manufacture at a cost which 
was as low as could possibly be figured all waste was eliminated he used his 
machines to their utmost capacity via a series of schedules which saved an immense amount 
of waste and demanded the least possible help he was constantly having trouble with the 
labor unions on this score for they objected to a policy which cut out duplication 
of effort and so eliminated their men he was an iron master however coarse brutal 
foul when dealing with them and they feared and respected him in the advertising end 
of the business things had been going rather badly for the reason that the magazines 
for which this department was supposed to get business had not been doing so well 
editorially they were out of touch with the times to a certain extentnot in advance 
of the feelings and emotions of the period and so the public was beginning to 
be inclined to look elsewhere for its mental pabulum they had had great circulation and 
great prestige that was when they were younger and the original publishers and editors in 
their prime since then days of weariness indifference and confusion had ensued only with the 
accession of colfax to power had hope begun to return as has been said he 
was looking for strong men in every quarter of this field but in particular he 
was looking for one man who would tell him how to govern them after he 
had them who was to dream out the things which would interest the public in 
each particular magazine proposition who was to draw great and successful authors to the book 
end of the house who was to inspire the men who were directing the various 
departments with the spirit which would bring public interest and success eugene might be the 
man eventually he hoped but how soon he was anxious to hurry his progress now 
that he had him it was not long after eugene was seated in his advertising 
managerial chair that he saw how things lay his men when he gathered them in 
conference complained that they were fighting against falling circulations you can talk all you want 
mr witla said one of his men gloomily but circulation and circulation only is the 
answer they have to keep up the magazines here all these manufacturers know when they 
get results we go out and get new business all the time but we don't 
keep it we can't keep it the magazines don't bring results what are you going 
to do about that i'll tell you what we are going to do replied eugene 
calmly we're going to key up the magazines i understand that a number of changes 
are coming in that direction they are doing better already the manufacturing department for one 
thing is in splendid shape i know that in a short time the editorial departments 
will be i want you people to put up at this time the best fight 
you know how under the conditions as they are i'm not going to make any 
changes here if i can help it i'm going to show you how it can 
be doneeach one separately i want you to believe that we have the greatest organization 
in the world and it can be made to sweep everything before it take a 
look at mr colfax do you think he is ever going to fail we may 
but he won't the men liked eugene's manner and confidence they liked his faith in 
them and it was not more than ten days before he had won their confidence 
completely he took home to the hotel where he and angela were stopping temporarily all 
the magazines and examined them carefully he took home a number of the latest books 
issued and asked angela to read them he tried to think just what it was 
each magazine should represent and who and where was the man who would give to 
each its proper life and vigor at once for the adventure magazine he thought of 
a man whom he had met years before who had since been making a good 
deal of a success editing a sunday newspaper magazine supplement jack bezenah he had started 
out to be a radical writer but had tamed down and become a most efficient 
newspaper man eugene had met him several times in the last few years and each 
time had been impressed by the force and subtlety of his judgment of life once 
he had said to him jack you ought to be editing a magazine of your 
own i will be i will be returned that worthy now as he looked at 
this particular proposition bezenah stuck in his mind as the man who should be employed 
he had seen the present editor but he seemed to have no force at all 
the weekly needed a man like townsend millerwhere would he find him the present man's 
ideas were interesting but not sufficiently general in their appeal eugene went about among the 
various editors looking at them ostensibly making their acquaintance but he was not satisfied with 
any one of them he waited to see that his own department was not needing 
any vast effort on his part before he said to colfax one day: things are 
not right with your editorial department i've looked into my particular job to see that 
there is nothing so radically behindhand there but what it can be remedied but your 
magazines are not right i wish aside from salary proposition entirely that you would let 
me begin to make a few changes you haven't the right sort of people upstairs 
i'll try not to move too fast but you couldn't be worse off than you 
are now in some instances i know it said colfax i know it what do 
you suggest simply better men that's all replied eugene better men with newer ideas it 
may cost you a little more money at present but it will bring you more 
back in the long run you're right you're right insisted colfax enthusiastically i've been waiting 
for someone whose judgment i thought was worth two whoops to come and tell me 
that for a long time so far as i'm concerned you can take charge right 
now the salary that i promised you goes with it i want to tell you 
something though i want to tell you something you're going in there now with full 
authority but don't you fall or stub your toe or get sick or make any 
mistakes if you do god help you if you do i'll eat you alive i'm 
a good employer witla i'll pay any price for good men within reason but if 
i think i'm being done or made a fool of or a man is making 
a mistake then there's no mercy in menot a single bit i'm a plain everyday 
blank blank blank and he used a term so foul that it would not bear 
repetition in print and that's all there is to me now we understand each other 
eugene looked at the man in astonishment there was a hard cold gleam in his 
blue eyes which he had seen there before his presence was electrichis look demoniac i've 
had a remark somewhat of that nature made to me before commented eugene he was 
thinking of summerfield's the coal shute for yours he had hardly expected to hear so 
cold and definite a proposition laid down so soon after his entry upon his new 
duties but here it was and he had to face it he was sorry for 
the moment that he had ever left kalvin i'm not at all afraid of responsibility 
replied eugene grimly i'm not going to fall down or stub my toe or make 
any mistakes if i can help it and if i do i won't complain to 
you well i'm only telling you said colfax smiling and goodnatured again the cold light 
was gone and i mean it in the best way in the world i'll back 
you up with all power and authority but if you fail god help you i 
can't he went back to his desk and eugene went upstairs he felt as though 
the red cap of a cardinal had been put upon his head and at the 
same time an axe suspended over him he would have to think carefully of what 
he was doing from now on he would have to go slow but he would 
have to go all power had been given himall authority he could go upstairs now 
and discharge everybody in the place colfax would back him up but he would have 
to replace them and that quickly and effectively it was a trying hour notable but 
grim his first move was to send for bezenah he had not seen him for 
some time but his stationery which he now had headed the united magazines corporation and 
in one corner office of the managing publisher brought him fast enough it was a 
daring thing to do in a way thus to style himself managing publisher when so 
many able men were concerned in the work but this fact did not disturb him 
he was bound and determined to begin and this stationerythe mere engraving of itwas as 
good a way as any of serving notice that he was in the saddle the 
news flew like wild fire about the building for there were many in his office 
even his private stenographer to carry the news all the editors and assistants wondered what 
it could mean but they asked no questions except among themselves no general announcement had 
been made on the same stationery he sent for adolph morgenbau who had exhibited marked 
skill at summerfield's as his assistant and who had since become art editor of the 
sphere a magazine of rising importance he thought that morgenbau might now be fitted to 
handle the art work under him and he was not mistaken morgenbau had developed into 
a man of considerable force and intelligence and was only too glad to be connected 
with eugene again he also talked with various advertising men artists and writers as to 
just who were the most live editorial men in the field at that time and 
these he wrote to asking if they would come to see him one by one 
they came for the fact that he had come to new york to take charge 
not only of the advertising but the editorial ends of the united magazines corporation spread 
rapidly over the city all those interested in art writing editing and advertising heard of 
it those who had known something of him in the past could scarcely believe their 
ears where did he get the skill eugene stated to colfax that he deemed it 
advisable that a general announcement be made to the staff that he was in charge 
i have been looking about he said and i think i know what i want 
to do the various editors art directors advertising men and book workers were called to 
the main office and colfax announced that he wished to make a statement which affected 
all those present mr witla here will be in charge of all the publishing ends 
of this business from now on i am withdrawing from any say in the matter 
for i am satisfied that i do not know as much about it as he 
does i want you all to look to him for advice and counsel just as 
you have to me in the past mr white will continue in charge of the 
manufacturing and distributing end of the business mr white and mr witla will work together 
that's all i have to say the company departed and once more eugene returned to 
his office he decided at once to find an advertising man who could work under 
him and run that branch of the business as well as he would he spent 
some time looking for this man and finally found him working for the haysrickert company 
a man whom he had known something of in the past as an exceptional worker 
he was a strong forceful individual of thirtytwo carter hayes by name who was very 
anxious to succeed in his chosen work and who saw a great opportunity here he 
did not like eugene so very wellhe thought that he was overestimatedbut he decided to 
work for him the latter put him in at ten thousand a year and then 
turned his attention to his new duties completely the editorial and publishing world was entirely 
new to eugene from the executive side he did not understand it as well as 
he did the art and advertising worlds and because it was in a way comparatively 
new and strange to him he made a number of initial mistakes his first was 
in concluding that all the men about him were more or less weak and inefficient 
principally because the magazines were weak when as a matter of fact there were a 
number of excellent men whom conditions had repressed and who were only waiting for some 
slight recognition to be of great value in the next place he was not clear 
as to the exact policies to be followed in the case of each publication and 
he was not inclined to listen humbly to those who could tell him his best 
plan would have been to have gone exceedingly slow watching the men who were in 
charge getting their theories and supplementing their efforts with genial suggestions instead he decided on 
sweeping changes and not long after he had been in charge he began to make 
them marchwood the editor of the review was removed as was gailer of the weekly 
the editorship of the adventure story magazine was given to bezenah in any organization of 
this kind however great improvements cannot be effected in a moment and weeks and months 
must elapse before any noticeable change can be shown instead of throwing the burden of 
responsibility on each of his assistants and leaving it there making occasional criticisms eugene undertook 
to work with each and all of them endeavoring to direct the policy intimately in 
each particular case it was not easy and to him at times it was confusing 
he had a great deal to learn still he did have helpful ideas in a 
score of directions daily and these told the magazines were improved the first issues which 
were affected by his judgment and those of his men were inspected closely by colfax 
and white the latter was particularly anxious to see what improvement had been made and 
while he could not judge well himself he had the means of getting opinions nearly 
all these were favorable much to his disappointment for he hoped to find things to 
criticize colfax who had been watching eugene's determined air the energy with which he went 
about his work and the manner in which he freely accepted responsibility came to admire 
him even more than he had before he liked him sociallyhis companionship after business hoursand 
began to invite him up to the house to dinner unlike kalvin on most of 
these occasions he did not take angela into consideration for having met her he was 
not so very much impressed with her she was nice but not of the same 
coruscating quality as her husband mrs colfax expressed a derogatory opinion and this also made 
it difficult he sincerely wished that eugene were single time passed as eugene worked more 
and more with the various propositions which this situation involved he became more and more 
at his ease those who have ever held an executive position of any importance know 
how easy it is given a certain degree of talent to attract men and women 
of ability and force according to that talent like seeks like and those who are 
looking for advancement in their world according to their talents naturally drift to those who 
are more highly placed and who are much like themselves advertising men artists circulation men 
editors book critics authors and all those who were sufficiently in his vein to understand 
or appreciate him sought him out and by degrees he was compelled to learn to 
refer all applicants to the heads of departments he was compelled to learn to rely 
to a certain degree on his men and having learned this he was inclined to 
go to the other extreme and rely too much in the case of carter hayes 
in the advertising department he was particularly impressed with the man's efficiency and rested on 
him heavily for all the details of that work merely inspecting his programs of procedure 
and advising him in difficult situations the latter appreciated this for he was egotistic to 
the roots but it did not develop a sense of loyalty in him he saw 
in eugene a man who had risen by some fluke of fortune and who was 
really not an advertising man at heart he hoped some day that circumstances would bring 
it about that he could be advertising manager in fact dealing directly with colfax and 
white whom because of their greater financial interest in the business he considered eugene's superiors 
and whom he proposed to court there were others in the other departments who felt 
the same way the one great difficulty with eugene was that he had no great 
power of commanding the loyalty of his assistants he had the power of inspiring themof 
giving them ideas which would be helpful to themselvesbut these they used as a rule 
merely to further their own interests to cause them to advance to a point where 
they deemed themselves beyond him because in his manner he was not hard distant bitter 
he was considered as a rule rather easy the men whom he employed and he 
had talent for picking men of very exceptional ability sometimes much greater than his own 
in their particular specialties looked upon him not so much as a superior after a 
time as someone who was in their path and to whose shoes they might properly 
aspire he seemed so good natured about the whole workso easy going now and then 
he took the trouble to tell a man that he was getting too officious but 
in the main he did not care much things were going smoothly the magazines were 
improving the advertising and circulation departments were showing marked gains and altogether his life seemed 
to have blossomed out into comparative perfection there were storms and daily difficulties but they 
were not serious colfax advised with him genially when he was in doubt and white 
pretended a friendship which he did not feel chapter xliii the trouble with this situation 
was that it involved more power comfort ease and luxury than eugene had ever experienced 
before and made him a sort of oriental potentate not only among his large company 
of assistants but in his own home angela who had been watching his career all 
these years with curiosity began to conceive of him at last as a genius in 
every respectdestined to some great preeminence in art or finance or the publishing world or 
all three she did not relax her attitude in regard to his conduct being more 
convinced than ever that to achieve the dizzy eminence to which he was now so 
rapidly ascending he must be more circumspect than ever people were watching him so closely 
now they were so obsequious to him but still so dangerous a man in his 
position must be so careful how he dressed talked walked don't make so much fuss 
he used to say to her for heaven's sake let me alone this merely produced 
more quarrels for angela was determined to regulate him in spite of his wishes and 
in his best interests grave men and women in various walks of lifeart literature philanthropy 
trade began to seek him out because in the first place he had an understanding 
mind and because in the next place which was much more important he had something 
to give there are always those in all walks of life who are seeking something 
through those avenues which a successful person represents whatever they may be and these together 
with those others who are always intensely eager to bask in the reflected glory of 
a rising luminary make a retinue for every successful man eugene had his retinue men 
and women of his own station or beneath it who would eagerly shake his hand 
with an oh yes indeed managing publisher of the united magazines corporation oh yes yes 
women particularly were prone to smile showing him even white teeth and regretting that all 
good looking and successful men were married in july following his coming from philadelphia the 
united magazines corporation moved into its new building and then he was installed into the 
most imposing office of his career a subtle assistant wishing to ingratiate the staff in 
eugene's good graces suggested that a collection be taken up for flowers his room which 
was done in white blue and gold with rose wood furniture to set it apart 
from the prevailing decorative scheme and so make it more impressive was scattered with great 
bouquets of roses sweet peas and pinks in beautiful and ornate vases of different colors 
countries and schools his great rosewood flattopped desk covered with a thick plate glass through 
which the polished wood shone brightly was decorated with flowers on the morning of his 
entry he held an impromptu reception on which occasion he was visited by colfax and 
white who after going to look at their new rooms came to his a general 
reception which followed some three weeks later and in which the successful representatives of various 
walks of life in the metropolis took part drew to the building a great crowd 
artists writers editors publishers authors and advertising men who saw him in all his glory 
on this occasion eugene with white and colfax did the receiving he was admired at 
a distance by striplings who wondered how he had ever accomplished such great results his 
rise had been so meteoric it seemed so impossible that a man who had started 
as an artist should change and become a dominant factor in literature and art from 
a publishing point of view in his own home his surroundings were equally showy he 
was as much a figure as he was in his office when he was alone 
with angela which was not so often for naturally they did a great deal of 
entertaining he was a figure even to her long ago she had come to think 
of him as someone who would some day dominate in the art world but to 
see him an imposing factor in the city's commercial life its principal publishers' representative having 
a valet and an automobile riding freely in cabs lunching at the most exclusive restaurants 
and clubs and associating constantly with someone who was of importance was a different matter 
she was no longer so sure of herself with him not so certain of her 
power to control him they quarreled over little things but she was not so ready 
to begin these quarrels he seemed changed now and deeper still she was afraid even 
yet that he might make a mistake and lose it all that the forces of 
ill will envy and jealousy which were everywhere apparent in life and which blow about 
so easily like gusts of wind would work him harm eugene was apparently at ease 
though he was troubled at times for his own safety when he thought of it 
for he had no stock in the company and was as beholden to colfax as 
any hall boy but he did not see how he could easily be dispensed with 
he was making good colfax was friendly to him he was surprised at times to 
see how badly the manufacturing arrangements could go awry affecting his dates of issue but 
white invariably had a good excuse colfax took him to his house in the country 
his lodge in the mountains on short yachting and fishing trips for he liked to 
talk to him but he rarely if ever invited angela he did not seem to 
think it was necessary to do this and eugene was afraid to impress the slight 
upon his attention much as he dreaded the thoughts which angela must be thinking it 
was eugene here and eugene there with constant calls of where are you old man 
from colfax who appeared not to want to be away from him well old man 
he would say looking him over much as one might a blood horse or a 
pedigree dog you're getting on this new job agrees with you you didn't look like 
that when you came to me and he would feel the latest suit eugene might 
be wearing or comment on some pin or tie he had on or tell him 
that his shoes were not as good as he could really get if he wanted 
to be perfect in dress colfax was for grooming his new prize much as one 
might groom a blood horse and he was always telling eugene little details of social 
life the right things to do the right places to be seen the right places 
to go as though eugene knew little or nothing now when we go down to 
mrs savage's friday afternoon you get a truxton portmanteau have you seen them well there's 
the thing got a london coat well you ought to have one those servants down 
there go through your things and they size you up accordingly nothing less than two 
dollars each goes and five dollars to the butler remember that he assumed and insisted 
after a fashion which eugene resented quite as much as he did his persistent ignoring 
of angela but he did not dare comment on it he could see that colfax 
was variable that he could hate as well as love and that he rarely took 
any intermediate ground eugene was his favorite now i'll send my car around for you 
at two friday he would say as though eugene did not keep a car when 
he was planning one of his weekend excursions you be ready at two on that 
day colfax's big blue touring car would come speeding up to the entrance of the 
apartment house and eugene's valet would carry down his bags golf sticks tennis racket and 
the various paraphernalia that go with a weekend's entertainment and off the car would roll 
at times angela would be left behind at times taken when eugene could arrange it 
but he found that he had to be tactful and accede to colfax's indifference mostly 
eugene would always explain to her how it was he was sorry for her in 
a way and yet he felt there was some justice in the distinction she was 
not exactly suited to that topmost world in which he was now beginning to move 
these people were colder sharper shrewder than angela they had more of that intense sophistication 
of manner and experience than she could achieve as a matter of fact angela had 
as much grace and more than many of the four hundred but she did lack 
that quickness of wit or that shallow selfsufficiency and assurance which are the almost invariable 
traits of those who shine as members of the smart set eugene was able to 
assume this manner whether he felt it or not oh that's all right she would 
say as long as you're doing it for business reasons she resented it nevertheless bitterly 
for it seemed such an uncalled for slur colfax had no compunctions in adjusting his 
companionship to suit his moods he thought eugene was well suited to this high life 
he thought angela was not he made the distinction roughly and went his way it 
was in this manner that eugene learned a curious fact about the social world and 
that was that frequently in these highest circles a man would be received where his 
wife would not and vice versa and that nothing very much was thought of it 
if it could be managed oh is that birkwood he heard a young swell once 
remark concerning an individual in philadelphia why do they let him in his wife is 
charming but he won't do and once in new york he heard a daughter ask 
her mother of a certain wife who was announcedher husband being at the same tablewho 
invited her i'm sure i don't know replied her mother i didn't she must have 
come of her own accord she certainly has her nerve with her replied the daughterand 
when the wife entered eugene could see why she was not good looking and not 
harmoniously and tastefully dressed it gave eugene a shock but in a way he could 
understand there were no such grounds of complaint against angela she was attractive and shapely 
her one weakness was that she lacked the blasé social air it was too bad 
he thought in his own home and circle however he thought to make up for 
this by a series of entertainments which grew more and more elaborate as time went 
on at first when he came back from philadelphia it consisted of a few people 
in to dinner old friends for he was not quite sure of himself and did 
not know how many would come to share his new honors with him eugene had 
never got over his love for those he had known in his youth he was 
not snobbish it was true that now he was taking naturally to prosperous people but 
the little ones the oldtime ones he liked for old lang syne's sake as well 
as for themselves many came to borrow money for he had associated with many ne'er 
do wells in his time but many more were attracted by his fame eugene knew 
intimately and pleasantly most of the artistic and intellectual figures of his day in his 
home and at his table there appeared artists publishers grand opera stars actors and playwrights 
his large salary for one thing his beautiful apartment and its location his magnificent office 
and his friendly manner all conspired to assist him it was his selfconscious boast that 
he had not changed he liked nice people simple people natural people he said for 
these were the really great ones but he could not see how far he had 
come in class selection now he naturally gravitated to the wealthy the reputed the beautiful 
the strong and able for no others interested him he hardly saw them if he 
did it was to pity or give alms it is difficult to indicate to those 
who have never come out of poverty into luxury or out of comparative uncouthness into 
refinement the veil or spell which the latter comes eventually to cast over the inexperienced 
mind coloring the world anew life is apparently striving constantly to perfect its illusions and 
to create spells there are as a matter of fact nothing but these outside that 
ultimate substance or principle which underlies it all to those who have come out of 
inharmony harmony is a spell and to those who have come out of poverty luxury 
is a dream of delight eugene being primarily a lover of beauty keenly responsive to 
all those subtleties of perfection and arrangement which ingenuity can devise was taken vastly by 
the nature of this greater world into which step by step apparently he was almost 
insensibly passing each new fact which met his eye or soothed his sensibilities was quickly 
adjusted to all that had gone before it seemed to him as though all his 
life he had naturally belonged to this perfect world of which country houses city mansions 
city and country clubs expensive hotels and inns cars resorts beautiful women affected manners subtlety 
of appreciation and perfection of appointment generally were the inherent concomitants this was the true 
heaventhat material and spiritual perfection on earth of which the world was dreaming and to 
which out of toil disorder shabby ideas mixed opinions nonunderstanding and all the ill to 
which the flesh is heir it was constantly aspiring here was no sickness no weariness 
apparently no ill health or untoward circumstances all the troubles disorders and imperfections of existence 
were here carefully swept aside and one saw only the niceness the health and strength 
of being he was more and more impressed as he came farther and farther along 
in the scale of comfort with the force and eagerness with which life seems to 
minister to the luxurylove of the human mind he learned of so many to him 
lovely things large wellkept magnificent country places scenes of exquisite beauty where country clubs hotels 
seaside resorts of all descriptions had been placed he found sport amusement exercise to be 
tremendously well organized and that there were thousands of people who were practically devoting their 
lives to this such a state of social ease was not for him yet but 
he could sit at the pleasures so amply spread between his hours of work and 
dream of the time to come when possibly he might do nothing at all yachting 
motoring golfing fishing hunting riding playing tennis and polo there were experts in all these 
fields he found card playing dancing dining lounging these seemed to occupy many people's days 
constantly he could only look in upon it all as upon a passing show but 
that was better than nothing it was more than he had ever done before he 
was beginning to see clearly how the world was organized how far were its reaches 
of wealth its depths of poverty from the lowest beggar to the topmost scenewhat a 
distance angela scarcely kept pace with him in all these mental peregrinations it was true 
that now she went to the best dressmakers only bought charming hats the most expensive 
shoes rode in cabs and her husband's auto but she did not feel about it 
as he did it seemed very much like a dream to herlike something that had 
come so suddenly and so exuberantly that it could not be permanent there was running 
in her mind all the time that eugene was neither a publisher nor an editor 
nor a financier at heart but an artist and that an artist he would remain 
he might attain great fame and make much money out of his adopted profession but 
some day in all likelihood he would leave it and return to art he seemed 
to be making sound investmentsat least they seemed sound to her and their stocks and 
bank accounts principally convertible stocks seemed a safe enough margin for the future to guarantee 
peace of mind but they were not saving so much after all it was costing 
them something over eight thousand dollars a year to live and their expenses were constantly 
growing larger rather than smaller eugene appeared to become more and more extravagant i think 
we are doing too much entertaining angela had once protested but he waived the complaint 
aside i can't do what i'm doing and not entertain it's building me up people 
in our position have to he threw open the doors finally to really remarkable crowds 
and most of the cleverest people in all walks of lifethe really exceptionally clevercame to 
eat his meals to drink his wines to envy his comfort and wish they were 
in his shoes during all this time eugene and angela instead of growing closer together 
were really growing farther and farther apart she had never either forgotten or utterly forgiven 
that one terrific lapse and she had never believed that eugene was utterly cured of 
his hedonistic tendencies crowds of beautiful women came to angela's teas lunches and their joint 
evening parties and receptions under eugene's direction they got together interesting programmes for it was 
no trouble now for him to command musical theatrical literary and artistic talent he knew 
men and women who could make rapid charcoal or crayon sketches of people could do 
feats in legerdemain and character representation could sing dance play recite and tell humorous stories 
in a droll and offhand way he insisted that only exceptionally beautiful women be invited 
for he did not care to look at the homely ones and curiously he found 
dozens who were not only extremely beautiful but singers dancers composers authors actors and playwrights 
in the bargain nearly all of them were brilliant conversationalists and they helped to entertain 
themselvesmade their own entertainment in fact his table very frequently was a glittering spectacle one 
of his stunts as he called it was to bundle fifteen or twenty people into 
three or four automobiles after they had lingered in his rooms until three o'clock in 
the morning and motor out to some outoftown inn for breakfast and to see the 
sun rise a small matter like a bill for for auto hire or thirtyfive dollars 
for a crowd for breakfast did not trouble him it was a glorious sensation to 
draw forth his purse and remove four or five or six yellow backed ten dollar 
bills knowing that it made little real difference more money was coming to him from 
the same source he could send down to the cashier at any time and draw 
from five hundred to a thousand dollars he always had from one hundred and fifty 
to three hundred dollars in his purse in denominations of five ten and twenty dollar 
bills he carried a small check book and most frequently paid by check he liked 
to assume that he was known and frequently imposed this assumption on others eugene witla 
eugene witla george he's a nice fellowor it's remarkable how he has come up isn't 
it i was at the witlas' the other night did you ever see such a 
beautiful apartment it's perfect that view people commented on the interesting people he entertained the 
clever people you met there the beautiful women the beautiful view and mrs witla is 
so charming but down at the bottom of all this talk there was also much 
envy and disparagement and never much enthusiasm for the personality of mrs witla she was 
not as brilliant as eugeneor rather the comment was divided those who liked clever people 
show wit brilliance ease liked eugene and not angela quite so much those who liked 
sedateness solidity sincerity the commoner virtues of faithfulness and effort admired angela all saw that 
she was a faithful handmaiden to her husband that she adored the ground he walked 
on such a nice little womanso homelike it's curious that he should have married her 
though isn't it they are so different and yet they appear to have lots of 
things in common too it's strangeisn't it chapter xliv it was in the course of 
his final upward progress that eugene came once more into contact with kenyon c winfield 
exstate senator of new york president of the long island realty company land developer real 
estate plunger financier artist what nota man very much of eugene's own type and temperament 
who at this time was doing rather remarkable things in a land speculative way winfield 
was tall and thin black haired black eyed slightly but not offensively hook nosed dignified 
gracious intellectual magnetic optimistic he was fortyeight years of age winfield was a very fair 
sample of your man of the world who has ideas dreams fancies executive ability a 
certain amount of reserve and judgment sufficient to hold his own in this very complicated 
mortal struggle he was not really a great man but he was so near it 
that he gave the impression to many of being so his deep sunken black eyes 
burned with a peculiar lustre one might almost have fancied a tint of red in 
them his pale slightly sunken face had some of the characteristics of your polished mephisto 
though not too many he was not at all devilish looking in the true sense 
of the word but keen subtle artistic his method was to ingratiate himself with men 
who had money in order to get from them the vast sums which he found 
it necessary to borrow to carry out the schemes or rather dreams he was constantly 
generating his fancies were always too big for his purse but he had such lovely 
fancies that it was a joy to work with them and him primarily winfield was 
a real estate speculator secondarily he was a dreamer of dreams and seer of visions 
his visions consisted of lovely country areas near some city stocked with charming country houses 
cut up with well paved tree shaded roads provided with sewers gas electricity suitable railway 
service street cars and all the comforts of a well organized living district which should 
be at once retired exclusive pleasing conservative and yet bound up tightly with the great 
metropolitan heart of new york which he so greatly admired winfield had been born and 
raised in brooklyn he had been a politician orator insurance dealer contractor and so on 
he had succeeded in organizing various suburban estateswinfield sunnyside ruritania the beecheslittle forty fifty one 
hundred and two hundred acre flats which with the help of o p m as 
he always called other people's money he had divided off into blocks laying out charmingly 
with trees and sometimes a strip of green grass running down the centre concrete sidewalks 
a set of noble restrictions and so forth anyone who ever came to look at 
a lot in one of winfield's perfect suburbs always found the choicest piece of property 
in the centre of this latest burst of improvement set aside for the magnificent house 
which mr kenyon c winfield the president of the company was to build and live 
in needless to say they were never built he had been round the world and 
seen a great many things and places but winfield or sunnyside or ruritania or the 
beeches so the lot buyers in these places were told had been finally selected by 
him deliberately as the one spot in all the world in which he hoped to 
spend the remainder of his days at the time eugene met him he was planning 
minetta water on the shores of gravesend bay which was the most ambitious of all 
his projects so far he was being followed financially by a certain number of brooklyn 
politicians and financiers who had seen him succeed in small things taking a profit of 
from three to four hundred per cent out of ten twenty and thirty acre flats 
but for all his brilliance it had been slow work he was now worth between 
three and four hundred thousand dollars and for the first time in his life was 
beginning to feel that freedom in financial matters which made him think that he could 
do almost anything he had met all sorts of people lawyers bankers doctors merchants the 
easy classes he called them all with a little money to invest and he had 
succeeded in luring hundreds of worthwhile people into his projects his great dreams had never 
really been realized however for he saw visions of a great warehouse and shipping system 
to be established on jamaica bay out of which he was to make millions if 
it ever came to pass and also a magnificent summer resort of some kind somewhere 
which was not yet clearly evolved in his mind his ads were scattered freely through 
the newspapers: his signs or rather the signs of his towns scattered broadcast over long 
island eugene had met him first when he was working with the summerfield company but 
he met him this time quite anew at the home of the w w willebrand 
on the north shore of long island near hempstead he had gone down there one 
saturday afternoon at the invitation of mrs willebrand whom he had met at another house 
party and with whom he had danced she had been pleased with his gay vivacious 
manner and had asked him if he wouldn't come winfield was here as a guest 
with his automobile oh yes said winfield pleasantly i recall you very well you are 
now with the united magazines corporationi understandsomeone was telling mea most prosperous company i believe 
i know mr colfax very well i once spoke to summerfield about you a most 
astonishing fellow that tremendously able you were doing that series of sugar plantation ads for 
them or having them done i think i copied the spirit of those things in 
advertising ruritania as you may have noticed well you certainly have improved your condition since 
then i once tried to tell summerfield that he had an exceptional man in you 
but he would have nothing of it he's too much of an egoist he doesn't 
know how to work with a man on equal terms eugene smiled at the thought 
of summerfield an able man he said simply he did a great deal for me 
winfield liked that he thought eugene would criticize him he liked eugene's genial manner and 
intelligent expressive face it occurred to him that when next he wanted to advertise one 
of his big development projects he would go to eugene or the man who had 
done the sugar plantation series of pictures and get him to give him the right 
idea for advertising affinity is such a peculiar thing it draws people so easily apart 
from volition or consciousness in a few moments eugene and winfield sitting side by side 
on the veranda looking at the greenwood before them the long stretch of open sound 
dotted with white sails and the dim distant shore of connecticut were talking of real 
estate ventures in general what land was worth how speculations of this kind turned out 
as a rule winfield was anxious to take eugene seriously for he felt drawn to 
him and eugene studied winfield's pale face his thin immaculate hands his suit of soft 
gray cloth he looked as able as his public reputation made him out to bein 
fact he looked better than anything he had ever done eugene had seen ruritania and 
the beeches they did not impress him vastly as territorial improvements but they were pretty 
nevertheless for middleclass people they were quite the thing he thought i should think it 
would be a pleasure to you to scheme out a new section he said to 
him once the idea of a virgin piece of land to be converted into streets 
and houses or a village appeals to me immensely the idea of laying it out 
and sketching houses to fit certain positions suits my temperament exactly i wish sometimes i 
had been born an architect it is pleasant and if that were all it would 
be ideal returned winfield the thing is more a matter of financing than anything else 
you have to raise money for land and improvements if you make exceptional improvements they 
are expensive you really can't expect to get much if any of your money back 
until all your work is done then you have to wait if you put up 
houses you can't rent them for the moment you rent them you can't sell them 
as new when you make your improvements your taxes go up immediately if you sell 
a piece of property to a man or woman who isn't exactly in accord with 
your scheme he or she may put up a house which destroys the value of 
a whole neighborhood for you you can't fix the details of a design in a 
contract too closely you can only specify the minimum price the house is to cost 
and the nature of the materials to be used some people's idea of beauty will 
vary vastly from others taste in sections may change a whole city like new york 
may suddenly decide that it wants to build west when you are figuring on its 
building east sowell all these things have to be taken into consideration that sounds logical 
enough said eugene but wouldn't the right sort of a scheme just naturally draw to 
itself the right sort of people if it were presented in the right way don't 
you fix the conditions by your own attitude you do you do replied winfield easily 
if you give the matter sufficient care and attention it can be done the pity 
is you can be too fine at times i have seen attempts at perfection come 
to nothing people with taste and tradition and money behind them are not moving into 
new additions and suburbs as a rule you are dealing with the new rich and 
financial beginners most people strain their resources to the breaking point to better their living 
conditions and they don't always know if they have the money it doesn't always follow 
that they have the taste to grasp what you are striving for and if they 
have the taste they haven't the money they would do better if they could but 
they can't a man in my position is like an artist and a teacher and 
a father confessor and financier and everything all rolled into one when you start to 
be a real estate developer on a big scale you must be these things i 
have had some successes and some notable failures winfield is one of the worst it's 
disgusting to me now i have always wished i could lay out a seaside resort 
or a suburb said eugene dreamily i've never been to but one or two of 
the resorts abroad but it strikes me that none of the resorts herecertainly none near 
new yorkare right the opportunities are so wonderful the things that have been done are 
horrible there is no plan no detail anywhere my views exactly said winfield i've been 
thinking of it for years some such place could be built and i suppose if 
it were done right it would be successful it would be expensive though very and 
those who come in would have a long wait for their money it would be 
a great opportunity to do something really worth while though said eugene no one seems 
to realize how beautiful a thing like that could be made winfield said nothing but 
the thought stuck in his mind he was dreaming a seaside improvement which should be 
the most perfect place of its kind in the worlda monument to himself if he 
did it if eugene had this idea of beauty he might help at least he 
might talk to him about it when the time came perhaps eugene might have a 
little money to invest it would take millions to put such a scheme through but 
every little would help besides eugene might have ideas which should make money both for 
himself and for winfield it was worth thinking about so they parted not to meet 
again for weeks and months but they did not forget each other book iii the 
revolt chapter i it was when eugene was at the height of his success that 
a meeting took place between himself and a certain mrs emily dale mrs dale was 
a strikingly beautiful and intelligent widow of thirtyeight the daughter of a welltodo and somewhat 
famous new york family of dutch extractionthe widow of an eminent banker of considerable wealth 
who had been killed in an automobile accident near paris some years before she was 
the mother of four children suzanne eighteen kinroy fifteen adele twelve and ninette nine but 
the size of her family had in no way affected the subtlety of her social 
personality and the delicacy of her charm and manner she was tall graceful willowy with 
a wealth of dark hair which was used in the most subtle manner to enhance 
the beauty of her face she was calm placid apparently while really running deep with 
emotion and fancies with manners which were the perfection of kindly courtesy and good breeding 
and with those airs of superiority which come so naturally to those who are raised 
in a fortunate and exclusive atmosphere she did not consider herself passionate in a marked 
degree but freely admitted to herself that she was vain and coquettish she was keen 
and observing with a single eye to the main chance socially but with a genuine 
love for literature and art and a propensity to write eugene met her through colfax 
who introduced him to her he learned from the latter that she was rather unfortunate 
in her marriage except from a money point of view and that her husband's death 
was no irreparable loss he also learned from the same source that she was a 
good mother trying to bring up her children in the manner most suitable to their 
station and opportunities her husband had been of a much poorer social origin than herself 
but her own standing was of the very best she was a gay social figure 
being invited much entertaining freely preferring the company of younger men to those of her 
own age or older and being followed ardently by one fortune hunter and another who 
saw in her beauty wealth and station an easy door to the heaven of social 
supremacy the dale home or homes rather were in several different placesone at morristown new 
jersey another on fashionable grimes hill on staten island a thirda city residence which at 
the time eugene met them was leased for a term of yearswas in sixtyseventh street 
near fifth avenue in new york city and a fourth a small lodge at lenox 
massachusetts which was also rented shortly after he met her the house at morristown was 
closed and the lodge at lenox reoccupied for the most part mrs dale preferred to 
dwell in her ancestral home on staten island which because of its commanding position on 
what was known as grimes hill controlled a magnificent view of the bay and harbor 
of new york manhattan its lower wall of buildings lay like a cloud at the 
north the rocking floor of the sea blue and gray and slate black by turn 
spread to the east in the west were visible the kill von kull with its 
mass of shipping and the orange hills in a boat club at tompkinsville she had 
her motor boat used mostly by her boy in her garage at grimes hill several 
automobiles she owned several riding horses retained four family servants permanently and in other ways 
possessed all those niceties of appointment which make up the comfortable life of wealth and 
ease the two youngest of her girls were in a fashionable boarding school at tarrytown 
the boy kinroy was preparing for harvard suzanne the eldest was at home fresh from 
boarding school experiences beginning to go out socially her début had already been made suzanne 
was a peculiar girl plump beautiful moody with at times a dreamy air of indifference 
and a smile that ran like a breath of air over water her eyes were 
large of a vague bluegray her lips rosy and arched her cheeks full and pink 
she had a crown of light chestnut hair a body at once innocent and voluptuous 
in its outlines when she laughed it was a rippling gurgle and her sense of 
humor was perfect if not exaggerated one of those naturally wise but as yet vague 
and formless artistic types which suspect without education nearly all the subtleties of the world 
and burst forth full winged and beautiful but oh so fragile like a butterfly from 
its chrysalis the radiance of morning upon its body eugene did not see her for 
a long time after he met mrs dale but when he did he was greatly 
impressed with her beauty life sometimes builds an enigma out of common clay and with 
a look from a twelveyearold girl sets a dante singing it can make a god 
of a bull a divinity of an ibis or a beetle set up a golden 
calf to be worshipped of the multitude paradox paradox in this case an immature and 
yet nearly perfect body held a seemingly poetic and yet utterly nebulous appreciation of lifea 
body so youthful a soul so fumbling that one would ask how should tragedy lurk 
in form like this a fool not quite yet so nebulous so much a dreamer 
that difficulty might readily follow in the wake of any thoughtless deed as a matter 
of fact favored as she was by nature and fortune her very presence was dangerousprovocative 
without thought of being so if a true artist had painted her synthesizing her spirit 
with her body he might have done so showing her standing erect on a mountain 
top her limbs outlined amidst fluttering draperies against the wind her eyes fixed on distant 
heights or a falling star out of mystery into mystery again so she came and 
went her mind was not unlike a cloud of mist through which the morning sun 
is endeavoring to break irradiating all with its flushes of pink and gold again it 
was like those impearled shells of the south sea without design yet suggestive of all 
perfections and all beauties dreams dreamsof clouds sunsets colors sounds which a too articulate world 
would do its best later to corrupt what dante saw in beatrice what abélard saw 
in héloïse romeo in juliet so some wondering swain could have seen in herand suffered 
a like fate eugene encountered mrs dale at a house party on long island one 
saturday afternoon and their friendship began at once she was introduced to him by colfax 
and because of the latter's brusque jesting spirit was under no illusions as to his 
social state you needn't look at him closely he observed gaily he's married that simply 
makes him all the more interesting she rippled and extended her hand eugene took it 
i'm glad a poor married man can find shelter somewhere he said smartly you should 
rejoice she replied it's at once your liberty and your protection think how safe you 
are i know i know he said all the slings and arrows of miss fortune 
hurtling by and you in no danger of being hurt he offered her his arm 
and they strolled through a window onto a veranda the day was just the least 
bit dull for mrs dale bridge was in progress in the card room a company 
of women and girls gambling feverishly eugene was not good at bridge not quick enough 
mentally and mrs dale did not care much for it i have been trying to 
stir up enough interest to bring to pass a motor ride but it doesn't work 
she said they all have the gambling fever today are you as greedy as the 
others i'm greedy i assure you but i can't play the greediest thing i can 
do is to stay away from the tables i save most that sharp faraday has 
cleaned me and two others out of four hundred dollars it's astonishing the way some 
people can play they just look at the cards or make mystic signs and the 
wretched things range themselves in serried ranks to suit them it's a crime it ought 
to be a penitentiary offense particularly to beat me i'm such an inoffensive specimen of 
the nonbridge playing family a burnt child you know stay away let's sit here they 
can't come out here and rob you they sat down in green willow chairs and 
after a time a servant offered them coffee mrs dale accepted they drifted conversationally from 
bridge to characters in societya certain climber by the name of bristow a man who 
had made a fortune in trunksand from him to travel and from travel to mrs 
dale's experiences with fortune hunters the automobile materialized through the intervention of others but eugene 
found great satisfaction in this woman's company and sat beside her they talked books art 
magazines the making of fortunes and reputations because he was or seemed to be in 
a position to assist her in a literary way she was particularly nice to him 
when he was leaving she asked where are you in new york riverside drive is 
our present abode he said why don't you bring mrs witla and come down to 
see us some weekend i usually have a few people there and the house is 
roomy i'll name you a special day if you wish do we'll be delighted mrs 
witla will enjoy it i'm sure mrs dale wrote to angela ten days later as 
to a particular date and in this way the social intimacy began it was never 
of a very definite character though when mrs dale met angela she liked her quite 
well as an individual whatever she may have thought of her as a social figure 
neither eugene nor angela saw suzanne nor any of the other children on this occasion 
all of them being away eugene admired the view tremendously and hinted at being invited 
again mrs dale was delighted she liked him as a man entirely apart from his 
position but particularly because of his publishing station she was ambitious to write others had 
told her that he was the most conspicuous of the rising figures in the publishing 
world being friendly with him would give her exceptional standing with all his editors she 
was only too pleased to be gracious to him he was invited again and a 
third time with angela and it seemed as though they were reaching or might at 
least reach something much more definite than a mere social acquaintance it was about six 
months after eugene had first met mrs dale that angela gave a tea and eugene 
in assisting her to prepare the list of invitations had suggested that those who were 
to serve the tea and cakes should be two exceptionally pretty girls who were accustomed 
to come to the witla apartment florence reel the daughter of a wellknown author of 
that name and marjorie mac tennan the daughter of a wellknown editor both beautiful and 
talented one with singing and the other with art ambitions angela had seen a picture 
of suzanne dale in her mother's room at daleview on grimes hill and had been 
particularly taken with her girlish charm and beauty i wonder she said if mrs dale 
would object to having suzanne come and help serve that day she would like it 
i'm sure there are going to be so many clever people here we haven't seen 
her but that doesn't matter it would be a nice way to introduce herself that's 
a good idea i should say observed eugene judicially he had seen the photo of 
suzanne and liked it though he was not overimpressed photos to him were usually gross 
deceivers he accepted them always with reservations angela forthwith wrote to mrs dale who agreed 
she would be glad to come herself she had seen the witla apartment and had 
been very much pleased with it the reception day came and angela begged eugene to 
come home early i know you don't like to be alone with a whole roomful 
of people but mr goodrich is coming and frederick allen one of their friends who 
had taken a fancy to eugene arturo scalchero is going to sing and bonavita to 
play scalchero was none other than arthur skalger of port jervis new jersey but he 
assumed this corruption of his name in italy to help him to success bonavita was 
truly a spanish pianist of some repute who was flattered to be invited to eugene's 
home well i don't care much about it replied eugene but i will come he 
frequently felt that afternoon teas and receptions were ridiculous affairs and that he had far 
better be in his office attending to his multitudinous duties still he did leave early 
and at fivethirty was ushered into a great roomful of chattering gesticulating laughing people a 
song by florence reel had just been concluded like all girls of ambition vivacity and 
imagination she took an interest in eugene for in his smiling face she found a 
responsive gleam oh mr witla she exclaimed now here you are and you just missed 
my song and i wanted you to hear it too don't grieve florrie he said 
familiarly holding her hand and looking momentarily in her eyes you're going to sing it 
again for me i heard part of it as i came up on the elevator 
he relinquished her hand why mrs dale delighted i'm sure so nice of you and 
arturo scalcherohullo skalger you old frost where'd you get the italian name bonavita fine am 
i going to hear you play all over alas marjorie mac tennan gee but you

and frederick allen my word what are you trying to grab off allen i'm on 
to you no bluffs nix nix why mrs schenckdelighted angela why didn't you tell me 
mrs schenck was coming i'd have been home at three by this time he had 
reached the east end of the great studio room farthest from the river here a 
tea table was spread with a silver tea service and behind it a girl ovalfaced 
radiantly healthy her full lips parted in a ripe smile her bluegray eyes talking pleasure 
and satisfaction her forehead laid about by a silver filigree band beneath which her brown 
chestnut curls protruded her hands eugene noted were plump and fair she stood erect assured 
with the least touch of quizzical light in her eye a white pinkbordered dress draped 
her girlish figure i don't know he said easily but i wager a guess that 
this isthat this isthis is suzanne dalewhat yes this is she replied laughingly can i 
give you a cup of tea mr witla i know you are mr witla from 
mama´'s description and the way in which you talk to everybody and how do i 
talk to everybody may i ask pleasum oh i can't tell you so easily i 
mean i can't find the words you know i know how it is though familiarly 
i suppose i mean will you have one lump or two three an thou pleasest 
didn't your mother tell me you sang or played oh you mustn't believe anything mama´ 
says about me she's apt to say anything tee hee it makes me laughshe pronounced 
it laafto think of my playing my teacher says he would like to strike my 
knuckles oh dear she went into a gale of giggles and sing oh dear dear 
that is too good eugene watched her pretty face intently her mouth and nose and 
eyes fascinated him she was so sweet he noted the configuration of her lips and 
cheeks and chin the nose was delicate beautifully formed fat not sensitive the ears were 
small the eyes large and wide set the forehead naturally high but so concealed by 
curls that it seemed low she had a few freckles and a very small dimple 
in her chin now you mustn't laugh like that he said mock solemnly it's very 
serious business this laughing in the first place it's against the rules of this apartment 
no one is ever ever ever supposed to laugh here particularly young ladies who pour 
tea tea epictetus well says involves the most serious conceptions of one's privileges and duties 
it is the highborn prerogative of tea servers to grin occasionally but never never never 
under any circumstances whatsoever suzanne's lips were beginning to part ravishingly in anticipation of a 
burst of laughter what's all the excitement about witla asked skalger who had drifted to 
his side why this sudden cessation of progress tea my son tea said eugene have 
a cup with me i will he's trying to tell me mr skalger that i 
should never laaf i must only grin her lips parted and she laughed joyously eugene 
laughed with her he could not help it mama´ says i giggle all the time 
i wouldn't do very well here would i she always pronounced it mama´ she turned 
to eugene again with big smiling eyes exceptions exceptions i might make exceptionsone exceptionbut not 
more why one she asked archly oh just to hear a natural laugh he said 
a little plaintively just to hear a real joyous laugh can you laugh joyously she 
giggled again at this and he was about to tell her how joyously she did 
laugh when angela called him away to hear florence reel who was going to sing 
again for his especial benefit he parted from miss dale reluctantly for she seemed some 
delicious figure as delicately colorful as royal dresden as perfect in her moods as a 
spring evening as soft soulful enticing as a strain of music heard through the night 
at a distance or over the water he went over to where florence reel was 
standing listening in a sympathetic melancholy vein to a delightful rendering of the summer winds 
are blowing blowing all the while he could not help thinking of suzanneletting his eyes 
stray in that direction he talked to mrs dale to henrietta tenmon to luke severas 
mr and mrs dula payalei stone now a writer of special articles and others but 
he couldn't help longing to go back to her how sweet she was how very 
delightful if he could only once more in his life have the love of a 
girl like that the guests began to depart angela and eugene bustled about the farewells 
because of the duties of her daughter which continued to the end mrs dale stayed 
talking to arthur skalger eugene was in and out between the studio and cloak room 
off the entry way now and then he caught glimpses of suzanne demurely standing by 
her tea cups and samovar for years he had seen nothing so fresh and young 
as her body she was like a new grown wet white lily pod in the 
dawn of the year she seemed to have the texture of the water chestnut and 
the lush fat vegetables of the spring her eyes were as clear as water her 
skin as radiant new ivory there was no sign of weariness about her nor any 
care nor any thought of evil nor anything except health and happiness such a face 
he thought casually in passing she is as sweet as any girl could be as 
radiant as light itself incidentally the personality of frieda roth came back andlong before herstella 
appleton youth youth what in this world could be finermore acceptable where would you find 
its equal after all the dust of the streets and the spectacle of age and 
wearinessthe crow's feet about people's eyes the wrinkles in their necks the makebelieve of rouge 
and massage and powder and cosmetics to see real youth not of the body but 
of the soul alsothe eyes the smile the voice the movementsall young why try to 
imitate that miracle who could who ever had he went on shaking hands bowing smiling 
laughing jesting making believe himself but all the while the miracle of the youth and 
beauty of suzanne dale was running in his mind what are you thinking about eugene 
asked angela coming to the window where he had drawn a rockingchair and was sitting 
gazing out on the silver and lavender and gray of the river surface in the 
fading light some belated gulls were still flying about across the river the great manufactory 
was sending off a spiral of black smoke from one of its tall chimneys lamps 
were beginning to twinkle in its hundredwindowed wall a great siren cry broke from its 
whistle as six o'clock tolled from a neighboring clock tower it was still late february 
and cold oh i was thinking of the beauty of this scene he said wearily 
angela did not believe it she was conscious of something but they never quarreled about 
what he was thinking nowadays they had come too far along in comfort and solidity 
what was it though she wondered that he was thinking about suzanne dale had no 
particular thought of him he was nicepleasant goodlooking mrs witla was quite nice and young 
mama she said did you look out of the window at mr witla's yes my 
dear wasn't that a beautiful view charming i should think you might like to live 
on the drive sometime mama we may sometime mrs dale fell to musing certainly eugene 
was an attractive manyoung brilliant able what a mistake all the young men made marrying 
so early here he was successful introduced to society attractive the world really before him 
and he was married to someone who though a charming little woman was not up 
to his possibilities oh well she thought so goes the world why worry everyone must 
do the best they can then she thought of a story she might write along 
this line and get eugene to publish it in one of his magazines chapter ii 
while these various events were occurring the work of the united magazines corporation had proceeded 
apace by the end of the first year after eugene's arrival it had cleared up 
so many of its editorial and advertising troubles that he was no longer greatly worried 
about them and by the end of the second year it was well on the 
way toward real success eugene had become so much of a figure about the place 
that everyone in the great building in which there were over a thousand employed knew 
him at sight the attendants were most courteous and obsequious as much so almost as 
they were to colfax and white though the latter with the improvement of the general 
condition of the company had become more dominating and imposing than ever white with his 
large salary of twentyfive thousand a year and his title of vicepresident was most anxious 
that eugene should not become more powerful than he had already it irritated him greatly 
to see the airs eugene gave himself for the latter had little real tact and 
instead of dissembling his importance before his superiors was inclined to flaunt it he was 
forever retailing to colfax some new achievement in the advertising circulation and editorial fields and 
that in white's presence for he did not take the latter very seriously telling of 
a new author of importance captured for the book department a new manuscript feature secured 
for one or another of the magazines a new circulation scheme or connection devised or 
a new advertising contract of great money value manipulated his presence in colfax's office was 
almost invariably a signal for congratulation or interest for he was driving things hard and 
colfax knew it white came to hate the sight of him well what's the latest 
great thing you've done colfax said once to eugene jovially in white's presence for he 
knew that eugene was as fond of praise as a child and so could be 
bantered with impunity white concealed a desire to sneer behind a deceptive smile no latest 
great thing only hayes has turned that hammond packing company trick that means eighteen thousand 
dollars' worth more of new business for next year that'll help a little won't it 
hayes hayes i'll be switched if i don't think he comes pretty near being a 
better advertising man than you are witla you picked him i'll have to admit that 
but he certainly knows all about the game if anything ever happened to you i 
think i'd like to keep him right there white pretended not to hear this but 
it pleased him hayes should be aided as much as possible by him eugene's face 
fell for this sudden twisting of the thread of interest from his to his assistant's 
achievements damped his enthusiasm it wasn't pleasant to have his inspirational leadership questioned or made 
secondary to the work of those whom he was managing he had brought all these 
men here and keyed the situation up was colfax going to turn on him oh 
very well he said sweetly don't look so hurt returned colfax easily i know what 
you're thinking i'm not going to turn on you you hired this man i'm simply 
telling you that if anything should happen to you i'd like to keep him right 
where he is eugene thought this remark over seriously it was tantamount to serving notice 
on him that he could not discharge hayes colfax did not actually so mean it 
at the moment though it was the seed of such a thought he simply left 
the situation open for consideration and eugene went away thinking what an extremely unfavorable twist 
this gave to everything if he was to go on finding good men and bringing 
them in here but could not discharge them and if then later they became offensive 
to him where would he be why if they found that out as they might 
through white they could turn on him as lions on a tamer and tear him 
to pieces this was a bad and unexpected twist to things and he did not 
like it on the other hand while it had never occurred to colfax before in 
this particular connection for he liked eugene it fitted in well with certain warnings and 
suggestions which had been issuing from white who was malevolently opposed to eugene his success 
in reorganizing the place on the intellectual and artistic sides was too much eugene's work 
was giving him a dignity and a security which was entirely disproportionate to what he 
was actually doing and which was threatening to overshadow and put in the limbo of 
indifference that of every other person connected with the business this must be broken colfax 
for the time being was so wrapped up in what he considered eugene's shining intellectual 
and commercial qualities that he was beginning to ignore white the latter did not propose 
that any such condition should continue it was no doubt a rare thing to find 
a man who could pick good men and make the place successful but what of 
himself colfax was naturally very jealous he knew and suspicious he did not want to 
be overshadowed in any way by any of his employees he did not feel that 
he was so far but now white thought it would be a fine thing to 
stir him up on this score if he couldto arouse his jealousy he knew that 
colfax did not care so much about the publishing world though now that he was 
in it and was seeing that it could be made profitable he was rather gratified 
by the situation his wife liked it for people were always talking to her about 
the united magazines corporation its periodicals its books its art products and that was flattering 
while it might not be as profitable as soap and woolens and railway stocks with 
which her husband was identified it was somewhat more distinguished she wanted him to keep 
it directly under his thumb and to shine by its reflected light in looking about 
for a club wherewith to strike eugene white discovered this he sounded colfax on various 
occasions by innuendo and noted his sniffing nostrils if he could first reach eugene's advertising 
circulation and editorial men and persuade them to look to him instead of to eugene 
he might later reach and control eugene through colfax he might humble eugene by curbing 
his power making him see that he white was still the power behind the throne 
what do you think of this fellow witla colfax would ask white from time to 
time and when these occasions offered he was not slow to drive in a wedge 
he's an able fellow he said once apparently most openmindedly it's plain that he's doing 
pretty well with those departments but i think you want to look out for his 
vanity he's just the least bit in danger of getting a swelled head you want 
to remember that he's still pretty young for the job he holds white was eight 
years older these literary and artistic people are all alike the one objection that i 
have to them is that they never seem to have any real practical judgment they 
make splendid second men when well governed and you can do almost anything with them 
if you know how to handle them but you have to govern them this fellow 
as i see him is just the man you want he's picking some good people 
and he's getting some good results but unless you watch him he's apt to throw 
them all out of here sometime or go away and take them all with him 
i shouldn't let him do that if i were you i should let him get 
just the men you think are right and then i should insist that he keep 
them of course a man has got to have authority in his own department but 
it can be carried too far you're treating him pretty liberally you know this sounded 
very sincere and logical to colfax who admired white for it for in spite of 
the fact that he liked eugene greatly and went about with him a great deal 
he did not exactly trust him the man was in a way too brilliant he 
thought he was a little too airy and light on his feet under pretext of 
helping his work and directing his policy without actually interfering so that it might eventually 
prove a failure white was constantly making suggestions he made suggestions which he told colfax 
eugene ought to try in the circulation department he made suggestions which he thought he 
might find advisable to try in the advertising department he had suggestions gathered from heaven 
knows where for the magazines and books and these he invariably sent through colfax taking 
good care however that the various department heads knew from what source they had originally 
emanated it was his plan to speak to hayes or gillmore who was in charge 
of circulation or one of the editors about some thought that was in his mind 
and then have that same thought come as an order via eugene the latter was 
so anxious to make good so goodnatured in his interpretation of suggestions that it did 
not occur to him for a long time that he was being played the men 
under him however realized that something was happening for white was hand and glove with 
colfax and the two were not always in accord with eugene he was not quite 
as powerful as white was the first impression and later the idea got about that 
eugene and white did not agree temperamentally and that white was the stronger and would 
win it is not possible to go into the long slow multitudinous incidents and details 
which go to make up office politics but anyone who has ever worked in a 
large or small organization anywhere will understand eugene was not a politician he knew nothing 
of the delicate art of misrepresentation as it was practised by white and those who 
were of his peculiarly subtle mental tendencies white did not like eugene and he proposed 
to have his power curbed some of eugene's editors after a time began to find 
it difficult to get things as they wanted them from the printing department and when 
they complained it was explained that they were of a disorderly and quarrelsome disposition some 
of his advertising men made mistakes in statement or presentation and curiously these errors almost 
invariably came to light eugene found that his strong men were most quickly relieved of 
their difficulties if they approached white but if they came to him it was not 
quite so easy instead of ignoring these petty annoyances and going his way about the 
big things he stopped occasionally to fight these petty battles and complaints and these simply 
put him in the light of one who was not able to maintain profound peace 
and order in his domain white was always bland helpful ready with a suave explanation 
it's just possible that he may not know how to handle these fellows after all 
he said to colfax and then if anyone was discharged it was a sign of 
an unstable policy colfax cautioned eugene occasionally in accordance with white's suggestions but eugene was 
now so well aware of what was going on that he could see where they 
came from he thought once of accusing white openly in front of colfax but he 
knew that this would not be of any advantage for he had no real evidence 
to go on all white's protestations to colfax were to the effect that he was 
trying to help him so the battle lay in the meantime eugene because of this 
or the thought rather that he might not always remain as powerful as he was 
having no stock in the concern and not being able to buy any had been 
interesting himself in a proposition which had since been brought to him by mr kenyon 
c winfield who since that memorable conversation at the home of the willebrands on long 
island had not forgotten him winfield had thought of him for a long time in 
connection with a plan he had of establishing on the south shore of long island 
some thirtyfive miles from new york a magnificent seaside resort which should outrival palm beach 
and the better places of atlantic city and give to new york close at hand 
such a dream of beauty and luxury as would turn the vast tide of luxuryloving 
idlers and successful money grubbers from the former resorts to this considerable thought had been 
given by him as to just what its principal characteristics should be but he had 
not worked it out to suit himself exactly and he thought eugene might be interested 
from the outlining point of view unfortunately on the face of it this was just 
the sort of scheme which made an appeal to eugene from all points of view 
in spite of the fact that he already had his hands as full as they 
could be nothing interested him quite so much as beauty and luxury in some artistic 
combination a summer resort of really imposing proportions with hotels casinos pagodas resident sections club 
houses a wide board or stone walk along the ocean and possibly a gambling center 
which should outrival monte carlo had long since occurred to him as something which might 
well spring up near new york he and angela had visited palm beach old point 
comfort virginia hot springs newport shelter island atlantic city and tuxedo and his impressions of 
what constituted luxury and beauty had long since widened to magnificent proportions he liked the 
interiors of the chamberlain at old point comfort and the royal ponciana at palm beach 
he had studied with artistic curiosity the development of the hotel features at atlantic city 
and elsewhere it had occurred to him that a restricted territory might be had out 
on the atlantic ocean near gravesend bay possibly which would include among other things islands 
canals or inland waterways a mighty sea beach two or three great hotels a casino 
for dancing dining gambling a great stone or concrete walk to be laid out on 
a new plan parallel with the ocean and at the back of all these things 
and between the islands and the ocean a magnificent seaside city where the lots should 
sell at so expensive a rate that only the welltodo could afford to live there 
his thought was of something so fine that it would attract all the prominent pleasurelovers 
he had recently met if they could be made to understand that such a place 
existed that it was beautiful showy exclusive in a money sense they would come there 
by the thousands nothing is so profitable as a luxury if the luxuryloving public want 
it colfax had once said to him and he believed it he judged this truth 
by the things he had recently seen people literally spent millions to make themselves comfortable 
he had seen gardens lawns walks pavilions pergolas laid out at an expense of thousands 
and hundreds of thousands of dollars where few would ever see them in st louis 
he had seen a mausoleum built upon the lines of the taj mahal the lawn 
about which was undermined by a steamheating plant in order that the flowers and shrubs 
displayed there might bloom all winter long it had never occurred to him that the 
day would come when he would have anything to do with such a dream as 
this or its ultimate fruition but his was the kind of mind that loved to 
dwell on things of the sort the proposition which winfield now genially laid before him 
one day was simple enough winfield had heard that eugene was making a good deal 
of money that his salary was twentyfive thousand a year if not more that he 
had houses and lots and some nice stock investments and it occurred to him as 
it would have to anyone that eugene might be able to shoulder a comfortable investment 
in some kind of land speculation particularly if he could see his way to make 
much more money in the long run the idea winfield had was as follows: he 
was going to organize a corporation to be known as the sea island development company 
to be capitalized at ten million dollars some two or three hundred thousand dollars of 
which was to be laid down or paid into the treasury at the start against 
this latter sum stock to the value of one million dollars or five shares of 
one hundred dollars par value each was to be issued that is whoever laid down 
one hundred dollars in cash was to receive in return three shares of common stock 
and two of preferred valued at one hundred dollars each bearing eight per cent interest 
this ratio was to be continued until in cash was in the treasury then those 
who came afterward and were willing to buy were only to receive two shares of 
common and one of preferred until one million in cash was in the treasury after 
that the stock was to be sold at its face value or more as the 
situation might dictate the original sum of two hundred thousands dollars was to go to 
purchase for the corporation an undeveloped tract of land half swamp half island and facing 
the atlantic ocean beyond gravesend bay now owned by winfield himself where a beautiful rolling 
beach of white sand stretched some three miles in length and without flaw or interruption 
this would clear winfield of a piece of property which was worth say but at 
present unsaleable and give him magnificent holdings in the new company besides he proposed to 
take a mortgage on this and all improvements the company might make in order to 
protect himself at the west end of this tractinland from the seawas a beautiful bay 
which though shallow gave access to a series of inlets and a network of waterways 
embracing nine small islands these waterways when dredged would be amply deep enough for yachts 
and small craft of all descriptions and the first important thought which occurred to winfield 
was that the mud and sand so dredged could be used to fill in the 
low marshy levels of soil between them and the sea and so make it all 
into high dry and valuable land the next thing was to devise a beautiful scheme 
of improvement and it was for this that he wished to talk to eugene chapter 
iii the matter was not difficult to arrange before winfield had gone ten sentences eugene 
began to take the ideas out of his mind i know something of that property 
he said studying a little outline map which winfield had prepared i've been out there 
duck shooting with colfax and some others it's fine property there's no doubt of it 
how much do they want for it well as a matter of fact i already 
own it said winfield it cost me sixty thousand dollars five years ago when it 
was a vast inaccessible swamp nothing has been done to it since but i will 
turn it over to the company for what it is worth nowtwo hundred thousand dollarsand 
take a mortgage for my protection then the company can do what it pleases with 
it but as president of course i should direct the line of development if you 
want to make a fortune and have fifty thousand dollars to spare here is your 
chance this land has increased in value from sixty to two hundred thousand dollars in 
five years what do you fancy it will be worth in ten years from now 
the way new york is growing it has pretty near four million people now in 
twentyfive years it is safe to say that there will be fourteen or fifteen millions 
scattered over this territory which lies within twentyfive miles of course this is thirtytwo miles 
away on a direct line but what of it the long island railroad will be 
glad to put a spur in there which would bring this territory within one hour 
of the city think of itone of the finest beaches on the atlantic ocean within 
one hour of new york i expect to interest mr wiltsie the president of the 
long island very heavily in this property i come to you now because i think 
your advertising and artistic advice are worth something you can take it or leave it 
but before you do anything i want you to come out and look over the 
property with me all told in stocks land free money in the banks and what 
he might save in a year or two eugene had about fifty thousand dollars of 
good hard cash which he could lay his hands on at a pinch he was 
well satisfied that winfield was putting before him one of those golden opportunities which prudently 
managed would make him a rich man nevertheless his fifty thousand was fifty thousand and 
he had it never again however once this other thing was under way if it 
were true would he have to worry about a position or whether he would be 
able to maintain his present place in society one could not possibly say what an 
investment like this might not lead to winfield so he told eugene expected eventually to 
clear six or eight million dollars himself he was going to take stock in some 
of the hotels casinos and various other enterprises which would be organized he could clearly 
see how later once this land was properly drained and laid out it would be 
worth from three to fifteen thousand dollars per lot of one hundred by one hundred 
feetthe smallest portions to be sold there were islands which for clubs or estates should 
bring splendid returns think of the leases to yacht and boat clubs alone the company 
would own all the land i would develop this myself if i had the capital 
said winfield but i want to see it done on a gigantic scale and i 
haven't the means i want something here which will be a monument to me and 
to all connected with it i am willing to take my chances pro rata with 
those who now enter and to prove my good faith i am going to buy 
as many shares as i possibly can on the fiveforone basis you or anyone else 
can do the same thing what do you think it's a great idea said eugene 
it seems as though a dream which had been floating about in the back of 
my head for years had suddenly come to life i can scarcely believe that it 
is true and yet i know that it is and that you will get away 
with it just as you are outlining it here you want to be very careful 
how you lay out this property though you have the chance of a lifetime for 
goodness' sake don't make any mistakes let's have one resort that will be truly beautifully 
right that's precisely the way i feel about it answered winfield and that's why i 
am talking to you i want you to come in on this for i think 
your imagination will be worth something you can help me lay this thing out right 
and advertise it right they talked on about one detail and another until finally eugene 
in spite of all his caution saw his dreams maturing in this particular proposition fifty 
thousand dollars invested here would give him two thousand five hundred sharesone thousand preferred and 
fifteen hundred commonwhose face value guaranteed by this magnificent piece of property would be think 
of it a quarter of a million and that subject to a natural increase which 
might readily carry him into the millionaire class his own brains would be of some 
value here for winfield was anxious to have him lay this out and this would 
bring him in touch with not only one of the best real estate men in 
the city but would bring him into contact with a whole host of financiers in 
business people who would certainly become interested in this venture winfield talked easily of architects 
contractors railroad men presidents of construction companies all of whom would take stock for the 
business opportunities it would bring to them later and also of the many strings to 
be pulled which later would bring great gains to the company and save it from 
expenditures which would otherwise mean millions in outlay thus this proposed extension by the long 
island which would cost that railroad two hundred thousand dollars would cost the sea island 
company nothing and would bring thousands of lovers of beauty there the moment conveniences were 
established to receive them this was true of hotels to be built each would bring 
business for everything else the company would lease the ground the great hotel men would 
do their own building according to restrictions and plans laid down by the sea island 
company the only real expenditure would be for streets sewers lights water walks trees and 
the great one hundred foot wide boardwalk with concrete ornaments which would be the finest 
sea stroll in the world but these could be undertaken by degrees eugene saw it 
all it was a vision of empire i don't know about this he said cautiously 
it's a great thing but i may not have the means to dip into it 
i want to think it over meanwhile i'll be glad to go out there and 
look over the ground with you winfield could see that he had eugene fascinated it 
would be an easy matter to land him once he had his plans perfected eugene 
would be the type of man who would build a house and come and live 
there in the summer he would interest many people whom he knew he went away 
feeling that he had made a good start and he was not mistaken eugene talked 
the matter over with angelahis one recourse in these mattersand as usual she was doubtful 
but not entirely opposed angela had considerable caution but no great business vision she could 
not really tell him what he ought to do thus far his judgment or rather 
his moves had been obviously successful he had been going up apparently because he was 
valuable as an assistant not because he was a born leader you'll have to judge 
for yourself eugene angela finally said i don't know it looks fine you certainly don't 
want to work for mr colfax all your life and if as you say they 
are beginning to plot against you you had better prepare to get out sometime we 
have enough now really to live on if you want to return to your art 
eugene smiled my art my poor old art a lot i've done to develop my 
art i don't think it needs developing you have it i'm sorry sometimes i ever 
let you leave it we have lived better but your work hasn't counted for as 
much what good has it done you outside the money to be a successful publisher 
you were as famous as you are now before you ever started in on this 
line and more so more people know you even now as eugene witla the artist 
than as eugene witla the magazine man eugene knew this to be so his art 
achievements had never forsaken him they had grown in fame always pictures that he had 
sold for two hundred and four hundred had gone up to as high as three 
and four thousand in value and they were still rising he was occasionally approached by 
an art dealer to know if he never intended to paint any more in social 
circles it was a constant cry among the elect why don't you paint any longer 
what a shame you ever left the art world those pictures of yours i can 
never forget them my dear lady eugene once said solemnly i can't live by painting 
pictures as i am living by directing magazines art is very lovely i am satisfied 
to believe that i am a great painter nevertheless i made little out of it 
and since then i have learned to live it's sad but it's true if i 
could see my way to live in half the comfort i am living in now 
and not run the risk of plodding the streets with a picture under my arm 
i would gladly return to art the trouble is the world is always so delightfully 
ready to see the other fellow make the sacrifice for art or literature's sake selah 
i won't do it so there it's a pity it's a pity said this observer 
but eugene was not vastly distressed similarly mrs dale had reproached him for she had 
seen and heard of his work some time some time he said grandly wait now 
at length this land proposition seemed to clear the way for everything if eugene embarked 
upon it he might gradually come to the point at which he could take some 
official position in connection with it anyhow think of a rising income from think of 
the independence the freedom surely then he could paint or travel or do as he 
pleased as a matter of fact after two automobile rides to the nearest available position 
on the site of the future resort and a careful study of the islands and 
the beach eugene devised a scheme which included four hotels of varying sizes one dining 
and dancing casino one gambling resort after the pattern of monte carlo a summer theatre 
a music pavilion three lovely piers motor and yacht club houses a park with radiating 
streets and other streets arranged in concentric rings to cross them there was a grand 
plaza about which the four hotels were ranged a noble promenade three miles in length 
to begin with a handsome railway station plots for five thousand summer homes ranging from 
five to fifteen thousand in price there were islands for residences islands for clubs islands 
for parks one of the hotels sat close to an inlet over which a dining 
veranda was to be builtstairs were to be laid down to the water so that 
one could step into gondolas or launches and be carried quickly to one of the 
music pavilions on one of the islands everything that money wanted was to be eventually 
available here and all was to be gone about slowly but beautifully so that each 
step would only make more sure each additional step eugene did not enter on this 
grand scheme until ten men himself included had pledged themselves to take stock up to 
each included in these were mr wiltsie president of the long island mr kenyon c 
winfield and milton willebrand the very wealthy society man at whose home he had originally 
met winfield the sea island company was then incorporated and on a series of dates 
agreed upon between them and which were dependent upon a certain amount of work being 
accomplished by each date the stock was issued to them in tenthousanddollar lots and then 
cash taken and deposited in the treasury by the end of two years after eugene 
had first been approached by winfield he had a choice collection of goldcolored certificates in 
the sea island realty and construction company which was building the now widely heralded seaside 
resortblue seawhich according to those interested was to be the most perfect resort of its 
kind in the world his certificates stated that they were worth and potentially they were 
eugene and angela looking at them thinking of the initiative and foresight of mr kenyon 
c winfield and the men he was associated with felt sure that some day and 
that not so very far distant they would yield their face value and much more 
chapter iv it had been while he was first perfecting his undertaking with winfield as 
to what his relationship to the new sea island construction company was to be that 
eugene had been dwelling more and more fondly upon the impression which suzanne dale had 
originally made upon him it was six weeks before they met again and then it 
was on the occasion of a dance that mrs dale was giving in honor of 
suzanne that eugene and angela were invited mrs dale admired angela's sterling qualities as a 
wife and while there might be temperamental and social differences she did not think they 
were sufficient to warrant any discrimination between them at least not on her part angela 
was a good womannot a social figure at allbut interesting in her way mrs dale 
was much more interested in eugene because in the first place they were very much 
alike temperamentally and in the next place because eugene was a successful and brilliant person 
she liked to see the easy manner in which he took life the air with 
which he assumed that talent should naturally open all doors to him he was not 
conscious apparently of any inferiority in anything but rather of a splendid superiority she heard 
it from so many that he was rapidly rising in his publishing world and that 
he was interested in many things the latest this project to create a magnificent summer 
resort winfield was a personal friend of hers he had never attempted to sell her 
any property but he had once said that he might some day take her staten 
island holdings and divide them up into town lots this was one possibility which tended 
to make her pleasant to him the evening in question eugene and angela went down 
to daleview in their automobile eugene always admired this district for it gave him a 
sense of height and scope which was not easily attainable elsewhere about new york it 
was still late winter and the night was cold but clear the great house with 
its verandas encased in glass was brightly lit there were a number of peoplemen and 
women whom eugene had met at various places and quite a number of young people 
whom he did not know angela had to be introduced to a great many and 
eugene felt that peculiar sensation which he so often experienced of a certain incongruity in 
his matrimonial state angela was nice but to him she was not like these other 
women who carried themselves with such an air there was a statuesqueness and a sufficiency 
about many of them to say nothing of their superb beauty and sophistication which made 
him feel when the contrast was forced upon him closely that he had made a 
terrible mistake why had he been so silly as to marry he could have told 
angela frankly that he would not at the time and all would have been well 
he forgot how badly emotionally he had entangled himself but scenes like these made him 
dreadfully unhappy why his life if he were single would now be but beginning as 
he walked round tonight he was glad to be free socially even for a few 
minutes he was glad that first this person and that took the trouble to talk 
to angela it relieved him of the necessity of staying near her for if he 
neglected her or she felt neglected by others she was apt to reproach him if 
he did not show her attention she would complain that he was conspicuous in his 
indifference if others refused to talk to her it was his place he should eugene 
objected to this necessity with all his soul but he did not see what he 
was to do about it as she often said even if he had made a 
mistake in marrying her it was his place to stick by her now that he 
had a real man would one of the things that interested him was the number 
of beautiful young women he was interested to see how full and complete mentally and 
physically so many girls appeared to be at eighteen why in their taste shrewdness completeness 
they were fit mates for a man of almost any age up to forty some 
of them looked so wonderful to himso fresh and ruddy with the fires of ambition 
and desire burning briskly in their veins beautiful girlsreal flowers like roses light and dark 
and to think the love period was all over for himcompletely over suzanne came down 
with others after a while from some room upstairs and once more eugene was impressed 
with her simple natural frank goodnatured attitude her light chestnutcolored hair was tied with a 
wide band of light blue ribbon which matched her eyes and contrasted well with her 
complexion again her dress was some light flimsy thing the color of peach blossoms girdled 
with ribbon and edged with flowers like a wreath soft white sandals held her feet 
oh mr witla she said gaily holding out her smooth white arm on a level 
with her eyes and dropping her hand gracefully her red lips were parted showing even 
white teeth arching into a radiant smile her eyes were quite wide as he remembered 
with an innocent surprised look in them which was wholly unconscious with her if wet 
roses could outrival a maiden in all her freshness he thought he would like to 
see it nothing could equal the beauty of a young woman in her eighteenth or 
nineteenth year yes quite mr witla he said beaming i thought you had forgotten my 
we look charming this evening we look like roses and cut flowers and stainedglass windows 
and boxes of jewels and and and he pretended to be lost for more words 
and looked quizzically up at the ceiling suzanne began to laugh like eugene she had 
a marked sense of the comic and the ridiculous she was not in the least 
vain and the idea of being like roses and boxes of jewels and stainedglass windows 
tickled her fancy why that's quite a collection of things to be isn't it she 
laughed her lips parted i wouldn't mind being all those things if i could particularly 
the jewels mama won't give me any i can't even get a brooch for my 
throat mama is real mean apparently said eugene vigorously we'll have to talk to mama 
but she knows you know that you don't need any jewels see she knows that 
you have something which is just as good or better but we won't talk about 
that will we suzanne had been afraid that he was going to begin complimenting her 
but seeing how easily he avoided this course she liked him for it she was 
a little overawed by his dignity and mental capacity but attracted by his gaiety and 
lightness of manner do you know mr witla she said i believe you like to 
tease people oh no said eugene oh never never nothing like that how could i 
tease people far be it from me that's the very last thing i ever think 
of doing i always approach people in a very solemn manner and tell them the 
dark sad truth it's the only way they need it the more truth i tell 
the better i feel and then they like me so much better for it at 
the first rush of his quizzical tirade suzanne's eyes opened quaintly inquiringly then she began 
to smile and in a moment after he ceased she exclaimed: oh ha ha oh 
dear oh dear how you talk a ripple of laughter spread outward and eugene frowned 
darkly how dare you laugh he said don't laugh at me it's against the rules 
to laugh anyhow don't you remember growing girls should never laugh solemnity is the first 
rule of beauty never smile keep perfectly solemn look wise hence therefore if and he 
lifted a finger solemnly and suzanne stared he had fixed her eye with his and 
was admiring her pretty chin and nose and lips while she gazed not knowing what 
to make of him he was very different very much like a boy and yet 
very much like a solemn dark master of some kind you almost frighten me she 
said now now listen it's all over come to i'm just a sillybilly are you 
going to dance with me this evening why certainly if you want me to oh 
that reminds me we have cards did you get one no well they're over here 
i think she led the way toward the reception hall and eugene took from the 
footman who was stationed there two of the little books let's see he said writing 
how greedy dare i be suzanne made no reply if i take the third and 
the sixth and the tenth would that be too many noo said suzanne doubtfully he 
wrote in hers and his and then they went back to the drawingroom where so 
many were now moving will you be sure and save me these why certainly she 
replied to be sure i will that's nice of you and now here comes your 
mother remember you mustn't ever ever ever laugh it's against the rules suzanne went away 
thinking she was pleased at the gaiety of this man who seemed so lighthearted and 
selfsufficient he seemed like someone who took her as a little girl so different from 
the boys she knew who were solemn in her presence and rather love sick he 
was the kind of man one could have lots of fun with without subjecting one's 
self to undue attention and having to explain to her mother her mother liked him 
but she soon forgot him in the chatter of other people eugene was thinking again 
though of the indefinable something in the spirit of this girl which was attracting him 
so vigorously what was it he had seen hundreds of girls in the last few 
years all charming but somehow this one she seemed so strong albeit so new and 
young there was a poise therea substantial quality in her soul which could laugh at 
life and think no ill of it that was it or something of it for 
of course her beauty was impressive but a courageous optimism was shining out through her 
eyes it was in her laugh her mood she would never be afraid the dance 
began after ten and eugene danced with first one and then anotherangela mrs dale mrs 
stevens miss willy when the third set came he went looking for suzanne and found 
her talking to another young girl and two society men mine you know he said 
smilingly she came out to him laughing stretching her arm in a sinuous way quite 
unconscious of the charming figure she made she had a way of throwing back her 
head which revealed her neck in beautiful lines she looked into eugene's eyes simply and 
unaffectedly returning his smile with one of her own and when they began to dance 
he felt as though he had never really danced before what was it the poet 
said of the poetry of motion this was it this was it this girl could 
dance wonderfully sweetly as a fine voice sings she seemed to move like the air 
with the sound of the twostep coming from an ambush of flowers and eugene yielded 
himself instinctively to the charmthe hypnotism of it he danced and in dancing forgot everything 
except this vision leaning upon his arm and the sweetness of it all nothing could 
equal this emotion he said to himself it was finer than anything he had ever 
experienced there was joy in it pure delight an exquisite sense of harmony and even 
while he was congratulating himself the music seemed to hurry to a finish suzanne had 
looked up curiously into his eyes you like dancing don't you she said i do 
but i don't dance well oh i think so she replied you dance so easily 
it is because of you he said simply you have the soul of the dance 
in you most people dance poorly like myself i don't think so she said hanging 
on to his arm as they walked toward a seat oh there's kinroy he has 
the next with me eugene looked at her brother almost angrily why should circumstances rob 
him of her company in this way kinroy looked like herhe was very handsome for 
a boy well then i have to give you up i wish there were more 
he left her only to wait impatiently for the sixth and the tenth he knew 
it was silly to be interested in her in this way for nothing could come 
of it she was a young girl hedged about by all the conventions and safeguards 
which go to make for the perfect upbringing of girlhood he was a man past 
the period of her interest watched over by conventions and interests also there could be 
absolutely nothing between them and yet he longed for her just the same for just 
this little sip of the nectar of makebelieve for a few minutes in her company 
married or not so many years older or not he could be happy in her 
company teasing her that sense of dancingthat sense of perfect harmony with beautywhen had he 
ever experienced that before the night went by and at one he and angela went 
home she had been entertained by some young officer in the army stationed at fort 
wadsworth who had known her brother david that had made the evening pleasant for her 
she commented on mrs dale and suzanne what a charming hostess the former was and 
how pretty and gay suzanne looked but eugene manifested little interest he did not want 
it to appear that he had been interested in suzanne above any of the others 
yes she's very nice he said rather pretty but she's like all girls at that 
age i like to tease them angela wondered whether eugene had really changed for good 
he seemed saner in all his talk concerning women perhaps large affairs had cured him 
completely though she could not help feeling that he must be charmed and delighted by 
the beauty of some of the women whom he saw five weeks more went by 
and then he saw suzanne one day with her mother on fifth avenue coming out 
of an antique shop mrs dale explained that she was looking after the repair of 
a rare piece of furniture eugene and suzanne were enabled to exchange but a few 
gay words four weeks later he met them at the brentwood hadleys in westchester suzanne 
and her mother were enjoying a season of spring riding eugene was there for only 
a saturday afternoon and sunday on this occasion he saw her coming in at halfpast 
four wearing a divided riding skirt and looking flushed and buoyant her lovely hair was 
flowing lightly about her temples oh how are you she asked with that same inconsequent 
air her hand held out to him at a high angle i saw you last 
in fifth avenue didn't i mama was having her chair fixed ha ha she's such 
a slow rider i've left her miles behind are you going to be here long 
just today and tomorrow he looked at her pretending gaiety and indifference is mrs witla 
here no she couldn't come a relative of hers is in the city i need 
a bath terribly said the desire of his eyes and passed on calling back: i'll 
see you again before dinner very likely eugene sighed she came down after an hour 
dressed in a flowered organdie a black silk band about her throat a low collar 
showing her pretty neck she picked up a magazine passing a wicker table and came 
down the veranda where eugene was sitting alone her easy manner interested him and her 
friendliness she liked him well enough to be perfectly natural with him and to seek 
him out where he was sitting once she saw he was there oh here you 
are she said and sat down taking a chair which was near him yes here 
i am he said and began teasing her as usual for it was the only 
way in which he knew how to approach her suzanne responded vivaciously for eugene's teasing 
delighted her it was the one kind of humor she really enjoyed you know mr 
witla she said to him once i'm not going to laugh at any of your 
jokes any more they're all at my expense that makes it all the nicer he 
said you wouldn't want me to make jokes at my expense would you that would 
be a terrible joke she laughed and he smiled they looked at a golden sunset 
filtering through a grove of tender maples the spring was young and the leaves just 
budding isn't it lovely tonight he asked oh yes she exclaimed in a mellow meditative 
voice the first ring of deep sincerity in it that he ever noticed there do 
you like nature he asked do i she returned i can't get enough of the 
woods these days i feel so queer sometimes mr witla as though i were not 
really alive at all you know just a sound or a color in the woods 
he stopped and looked at her the simile caught him quite as any notable characteristic 
in anyone would have caught him what was the color and complexity of this girl's 
mind was she so wise so artistic and so emotional that nature appealed to her 
in a deep way was this wonderful charm that he felt the shadow or radiance 
of something finer still so that's the way it is is it he asked yes 
she said quietly he sat and looked at her and she eyed him as solemnly 
why do you look at me so she asked why do you say such curious 
things he answered what did i say i don't believe you really know well never 
mind let us walk will you do you mind it's still an hour to dinner 
i'd like to go over and see what's beyond those trees they went down a 
little path bordered with grass and under green budding twigs it came to a stile 
finally and looked out upon a stony green field where some cows were pasturing oh 
the spring the spring exclaimed eugene and suzanne answered: you know mr witla i think 
we must be something alike in some ways that's just the way i feel how 
do you know how i feel i can tell by your voice she said can 
you really why yes why shouldn't i what a strange girl you are he said 
thoughtfully i don't think i understand you quite why why am i so different from 
everyone else quite quite he said at least to me i have never seen anyone 
quite like you before chapter v it was after this meeting that vague consciousness came 
to suzanne that mr witla as she always thought of him to herself was just 
a little more than very nice to her he was so gentle so meditative and 
withal so gay when he was near her he seemed fairly to bubble whenever he 
came into her presence never to have any cause for depression or gloom such as 
sometimes seized on her when she was alone he was always immaculately dressed and had 
great affairs so her mother said they discussed him once at table at daleview and 
mrs dale said she thought he was charming he's one of the nicest fellows that 
comes here i think said kinroy i don't like that stick woodward he was referring 
to another man of about eugene's age who admired his mother mrs witla is such 
a queer little woman said suzanne she's so different from mr witla he's so gay 
and goodnatured and she's so reserved is she as old as he is mama i 
don't think so said mrs dale who was deceived by angela's apparent youth what makes 
you ask oh i just wondered said suzanne who was vaguely curious concerning things in 
connection with eugene there were several other meetings one of which eugene engineered once when 
he persuaded angela to invite suzanne and her mother to a spring night revel they 
were having at the studio and the other when he and angela were invited to 
the willebrands where the dales were also angela was always with him mrs dale almost 
always with suzanne there were a few conversations but they were merely gay inconsequent makebelieve 
talks in which suzanne saw eugene as one who was forever happy she little discerned 
the brooding depths of longing that lay beneath his gay exterior the climax was brought 
about however when one july day after a short visit to one of the summer 
resorts angela was taken ill she had always been subject to colds and sore throats 
and these peculiar signs which are associated by medical men with latent rheumatism finally culminated 
in this complaint angela had also been pronounced to have a weak heart and this 
combined with a sudden severe rheumatic attack completely prostrated her a trained nurse had to 
be called and angela's sister marietta was sent for eugene's sister myrtle who now lived 
in new york was asked by him to come over and take charge and under 
her supervision pending marietta's arrival his household went forward smoothly enough the former being a 
fullfledged christian scientist having been instantly cured as she asserted of a longstanding nervous complaint 
was for calling a christian science practitioner but eugene would have none of it he 
could not believe that there was anything in this new religious theory and thought angela 
needed a doctor he sent for a specialist in her complaint he pronounced that six 
weeks at the least perhaps two months must elapse before angela would be able to 
sit up again her system is full of rheumatism said her physician she is in 
a very bad way rest and quiet and constant medication will bring her round eugene 
was sorry he did not want to see her suffer but her sickness did not 
for one minute alter his mental attitude in fact he did not see how it 
could it did not change their relative mental outlook in any way their peculiar relationship 
of guardian and restless ward was quite unaffected all social functions of every kind were 
now abandoned and eugene stayed at home every evening curious to see what the outcome 
would be he wanted to see how the trained nurse did her work and what 
the doctor thought would be the next step he had a great deal to do 
at all times reading consulting and many of those who wished to confer with him 
came to the apartment of an evening all those who knew them socially at all 
intimately called or sent messages of condolence and among those who came were mrs dale 
and suzanne the former because eugene had been so nice to her in a publishing 
way and was shortly going to bring out her first attempt at a novel was 
most assiduous she sent flowers and came often proffering the services of suzanne for any 
day that the nurse might wish to be off duty or myrtle could not be 
present she thought angela might like to have suzanne read to her at least the 
offer sounded courteous and was made in good faith suzanne did not come alone at 
first but after a time when angela had been ill four weeks and eugene had 
stood the heat of the town apartment nightly for the chance of seeing her she 
did mrs dale suggested that he should run down to her place over saturday and 
sunday it was not far they were in close telephone communication it would rest him 
eugene though angela had suggested it a number of times before had refused to go 
to any seaside resort or hotel even for saturday and sunday his statement being that 
he did not care to go alone at this time the truth was he was 
becoming so interested in suzanne that he did not care to go anywhere save somewhere 
that he might see her again mrs dale's offer was welcome enough but having dissembled 
so much he had to dissemble more mrs dale insisted angela added her plea myrtle 
thought he ought to go he finally ordered the car to take him down one 
friday afternoon and leave him suzanne was out somewhere but he sat on the veranda 
and basked in the magnificent view it gave of the lower bay kinroy and some 
young friend together with two girls were playing tennis on one of the courts eugene 
went out to watch them and presently suzanne returned ruddy from a walk she had 
taken to a neighbor's house at the sight of her every nerve in eugene's body 
tingledhe felt a great exaltation and it seemed as though she responded in kind for 
she was particularly gay and laughing they have a four she called to him her 
white duck skirt blowing let's you and i get rackets and play single i'm not 
very good you know he said you couldn't be worse than i am she replied 
i'm so bad kinroy won't let me play in any game with him ha ha 
such being the case eugene said lightly and followed her to get the rackets they 
went to the second court where they played practically unheeded every hit was a signal 
for congratulation on the part of one or the other every miss for a burst 
of laughter or a jest eugene devoured suzanne with his eyes and she looked at 
him continually in wideeyed sweetness scarcely knowing what she was doing her own hilarity on 
this occasion was almost inexplicable to her it seemed as though she was possessed of 
some spirit of joy which she couldn't control she confessed to him afterward that she 
had been wildly glad exalted and played with freedom and abandon though at the same 
time she was frightened and nervous to eugene she was of course ravishing to behold 
she could not play as she truly said but it made no difference her motions 
were beautiful mrs dale had long admired eugene's youthful spirit she watched him now from 
one of the windows and thought of him much as one might of a boy 
he and suzanne looked charming playing together it occurred to her that if he were 
single he would not make a bad match for her daughter fortunately he was sane 
prudent charming more like a guardian to suzanne than anything else her friendship for him 
was rather a healthy sign after dinner it was proposed by kinroy that he and 
his friends and suzanne go to a dance which was being given at a club 
house near the government fortifications at the narrows where they spread out into the lower 
bay mrs dale not wishing to exclude eugene who was depressed at the thought of 
suzanne's going and leaving him behind suggested that they all go she did not care 
so much for dancing herself but suzanne had no partner and kinroy and his friend 
were very much interested in the girls they were taking a car was called and 
they sped to the club to find it dimly lighted with chinese lanterns and an 
orchestra playing softly in the gloom now you go ahead and dance said her mother 
to suzanne i want to sit out here and look at the water a while 
i'll watch you through the door eugene held out his hand to suzanne who took 
it and in a moment they were whirling round a kind of madness seized them 
both for without a word or look they drew close to each other and danced 
furiously in a clinging ecstasy of joy oh how lovely suzanne exclaimed at one turn 
of the room where passing an open door they looked out and saw a full 
lighted ship passing silently by in the distant dark a sail boat its one great 
sail enveloped in a shadowy quiet floated wraithlike nearer still do scenes like that appeal 
to you so asked eugene oh do they she pulsated they take my breath away 
this does too it's so lovely eugene sighed he understood now never he said to 
himself was the soul of an artist so akin to his own and so enveloped 
in beauty this same thirst for beauty that was in him was in her and 
it was pulling her to him only her soul was so exquisitely set in youth 
and beauty and maidenhood that it overawed and frightened him it seemed impossible that she 
should ever love him these eyes this face of hershow they enchanted him he was 
drawn as by a strong cord and so was sheby an immense terrible magnetism he 
had felt it all the afternoon keenly he was feeling it intensely now he pressed 
her to his bosom and she yielded yearningly suiting her motions to his subtlest moods 
he wanted to exclaim: oh suzanne oh suzanne but he was afraid if he said 
anything to her it would frighten her she did not really dream as yet what 
it all meant you know he said when the music stopped i'm quite beside myself 
it's narcotic i feel like a boy oh if they would only go on was 
all she said and together they went out on the veranda where there were no 
lights but only chairs and the countless stars well said mrs dale i'm afraid you 
don't love to dance as well as i do observed eugene calmly sitting down beside 
her i'm afraid i don't seeing how joyously you do it i've been watching you 
you two dance well together kinroy won't you have them bring us ices suzanne had 
slipped away to the side of her brother's friends she talked to them cheerily the 
while eugene watched her but she was intensely conscious of his presence and charm she 
tried to think what she was doing but somehow she could notshe could only feel 
the music struck up again and for looks' sake he let her dance with her 
brother's friend the next was his and the next for kinroy preferred to sit out 
one and his friend also suzanne and eugene danced the major portions of the dances 
together growing into a wild exaltation which however was wordless except for a certain eagerness 
which might have been read into what they said their hands spoke when they touched 
and their eyes when they met suzanne was intensely shy and fearsome she was really 
half terrified by what she was doingafraid lest some word or thought would escape eugene 
and she wanted to dwell in the joy of this he went once between two 
dances when she was hanging over the rail looking at the dark gurgling water below 
and leaned over beside her how wonderful this night is he said yes yes she 
exclaimed and looked away do you wonder at all at the mystery of life oh 
yes oh yes all the time and you are so young he said passionately intensely 
sometimes you know mr witla she sighed i do not like to think why oh 
i don't know i just can't tell you i can't find words i don't know 
there was an intense pathos in her phrasing which meant everything to his understanding he 
understood how voiceless a great soul really might be new born without an earthmanufactured vocabulary 
it gave him a clearer insight into a thought he had had for a long 
while and that was that we came as wordsworth expressed it trailing clouds of glory 
but from where her soul must be intensely wiseelse why his yearning to her but 
oh the pathos of her voicelessness they went home in the car and late that 
night while he was sitting on the veranda smoking to soothe his fevered brain there 
was one other scene the night was intensely warm everywhere except on this hill where 
a cool breeze was blowing the ships on the sea and bay were manytwinkling little 
lightsand the stars in the sky were as a great army see how the floor 
of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold he quoted to himself a 
door opened and suzanne came out of the library which opened on to the veranda 
he had not expected to see her again nor she him the beauty of the 
night had drawn her suzanne he said when the door opened she looked at him 
poised in uncertainty her lovely white face glowing like a pale phosphorescent light in the 
dark isn't it beautiful out here come sit down no she said i mustn't stay 
it is so beautiful she looked about her vaguely nervously and then at him oh 
that breeze she turned up her nose and sniffed eagerly the music is still whirling 
in my head he said coming to her i cannot get over tonight he spoke 
softlyalmost in a whisperand threw his cigar away suzanne's voice was low she looked at 
him and filled her deep broad chest with air oh she sighed throwing back her 
head her neck curving divinely one more dance he said taking her right hand and 
putting his left upon her waist she did not retreat from him but looked half 
distrait half entranced in his eyes without music she asked she was almost trembling you 
are music he replied her intense sense of suffocation seizing him they moved a few 
paces to the left where there were no windows and where no one could see 
he drew her close to him and looked into her face but still he did 
not dare say what he thought they moved about softly and then she gurgled that 
soft laugh that had entranced him from the first what would people think she asked 
they walked to the railing he still holding her hand and then she withdrew it 
he was conscious of great dangerof jeopardizing a wonderfully blissful relationship and finally said: perhaps 
we had better go yes she said mama would be greatly disturbed if she knew 
this she walked ahead of him to the door good night she whispered good night 
he sighed he went back to his chair and meditated on the course he was 
pursuing this was a terrible risk should he go on the flowerlike face of suzanne 
came back to himher supple body her wondrous grace and beauty oh perhaps not but 
what a loss what a lure to have flaunted in front of his eyes were 
there ever thoughts and feelings like these in so young a body never never never 
had he seen her like never in all his experiences had he seen anything so 
exquisite she was like the budding woods in spring like little white and blue flowers 
growing if life now for once would only be kind and give him her oh 
suzanne suzanne he breathed to himself lingering over the name for a fourth or a 
fifth time eugene was imagining himself to be terribly eagerly fearsomely in love chapter vi 
this burst of emotion with its tentative understanding so subtly reached changed radically and completely 
the whole complexion of life for eugene once more now the spirit of youth had 
returned to him he had been resenting all this while in spite of his success 
the passage of time for he was daily and hourly growing older and what had 
he really achieved the more eugene had looked at life through the medium of his 
experiences the more it had dawned on him that somehow all effort was pointless to 
where and what did one attain when one attained success was it for houses and 
lands and fine furnishings and friends that one was really striving was there any such 
thing as real friendship in life and what were its fruitsintense satisfaction in some few 
instances perhaps but in the main what a sorry jest most socalled friendships veiled how 
often they were coupled with selfinterest selfseeking selfeverything we associated in friendship mostly only with 
those who were of our own social station a good friend did he possess one 
an inefficient friend would one such long be his friend life moved in schools of 
those who could run a certain pace maintain a certain standard of appearances compel a 
certain grade of respect and efficiency in others colfax was his friendfor the present so 
was winfield about him were scores and hundreds who were apparently delighted to grasp his 
hand but for what his fame certainly his efficiency yes only by the measure of 
his personal power and strength could he measure his friendsno more and as for lovewhat 
had he ever had of love before when he went back in his mind it 
seemed now that all each and every one had been combined in some way with 
lust and evil thinking could he say that he had ever been in love truly 
certainly not with margaret duff or ruby kenny or angelathough that was the nearest he 
had come to true loveor christina channing he had liked all these women very much 
as he had carlotta wilson but had he ever loved one never angela had won 
him through his sympathy for her he told himself now he had been induced to 
marry out of remorse and here he was now having lived all these years and 
come all this way without having truly loved now behold suzanne dale with her perfection 
of soul and body and he was wild about hernot for lust but for love 
he wanted to be with her to hold her hands to kiss her lips to 
watch her smile but nothing more it was true her body had its charm in 
extremes it would draw him but the beauty of her mind and appearancethere lay the 
fascination he was heartsick at being compelled to be absent from her and yet he 
did not know that he would ever be able to attain her at all as 
he thought of his condition it rather terrified and nauseated him to think after having 
known this one hour of wonder and superlative bliss of being compelled to come back 
into the workaday world nor were things improving at the office of the united magazines 
corporation instead of growing better they were growing worse with the diversity of his interests 
particularly the interest he held in the sea island realty and construction company he was 
growing rather lackadaisical in his attitude toward all magazine interests with which he was connected 
he had put in strong men wherever he could find them but these had come 
to be very secure in their places working without very much regard to him since 
he could not give them very much attention white and colfax had become intimate with 
many of them personally some of them such as hayes the advertising man the circulation 
manager the editor of the international review the editor in charge of books were so 
very able that although it was true that eugene had hired them it was practically 
settled that they could not be removed colfax and white had come to understand by 
degrees that eugene was a person who however brilliant he might be in selecting men 
was really not capable of attention to detail he could not bring his mind down 
to small practical points if he had been an owner like colfax or a practical 
henchman like white he would have been perfectly safe but being a naturalborn leader or 
rather organizer he was unless he secured control in the beginning rather hopeless and helpless 
when organization was completed others could attend to details better than he could colfax came 
to know his men and like them in absences which had become more frequent as 
eugene became more secure and as he took up with winfield they had first gone 
to colfax for advice and later in colfax's absence to white the latter received them 
with open arms indeed among themselves his lieutenants frequently discussed eugene and agreed that in 
organizing or rather reorganizing the place he had done his great work he might have 
been worth twentyfive thousand a year doing that but hardly as a man to sit 
about and cool his heels after the work was done white had persistently whispered suggestions 
of eugene's commercial inefficiency for the task he was essaying to colfax he is really 
trying to do up there what you ought to be doing he told him and 
what you can do better you want to remember that you've learned a lot since 
you came in here and so has he only he has become a little less 
practical and you have become more so these men of his look more to you 
now than they do to him colfax rejoiced in the thought he liked eugene but 
he liked the idea better that his business interests were perfectly safe he did not 
like to think that any one man was becoming so strong that his going would 
injure him and this thought for a long time during eugene's early ascendancy had troubled 
him the latter had carried himself with such an air eugene had fancied that colfax 
needed to be impressed with his importance and this in addition to his very thorough 
work was one way to do it his manner had grated on colfax after a 
time for he was the soul of vainglory himself and he wanted no other gods 
in the place beside himself white on the contrary was constantly subservient and advisory in 
his manner it made a great difference by degrees through one process and another eugene 
had lost ground but it was only in a nebulous way as yet and not 
in anything tangible if he had never turned his attention to anything else had never 
wearied of any detail and kept close to colfax and to his own staff he 
would have been safe as it was he began now to neglect them more than 
ever and this could not fail to tell rather disastrously in the long run in 
the first place the prospects in connection with the sea island construction company were apparently 
growing brighter and brighter it was one of those schemes which would take years and 
years to develop but it did not look that way at first rather it seemed 
to be showing tangible evidences of accomplishment the first year after a good deal of 
money had been invested considerable dredging operations were carried out and dry land appeared in 
many placesa long stretch of good earth to the rear of the main beach whereon 
hotels and resorts of all sorts could be constructed the boardwalk was started after a 
model prepared by eugene and approvedafter modificationby the architect engaged and a portion of the 
future great dining and dancing casinos was begun and completed a beautiful building modeled on 
a combination of the moorish spanish and old mission styles a notable improvement in design 
had been effected in this scheme for the color of blue sea according to eugene's 
theory was to be red white yellow blue and green done in spirited yet simple 
outlines the walls of all buildings were to be white and yellow latticed with green 
the roofs porticos lintels piers and steps were to be red yellow green and blue 
there were to be round shallow italian pools of concrete in many of the courts 
and interiors of the houses the hotels were to be western modifications of the giralda 
in spain each one a size smaller or larger than the other green spear pines 
and tall coneshaped poplars were to be the prevailing tree decorations the railroad as mr 
winfield promised had already completed its spur and spanish depot which was beautiful it looked 
truly as though blue sea would become what winfield said it would become the seaside 
resort of america the actuality of this progress fascinated eugene so much that he gave 
until suzanne appeared much more time than he really should have to the development of 
the scheme as in the days when he first went with summerfield he worked of 
nights on exterior and interior layouts as he called themfaçades ground arrangements island improvements and 
so on he went frequently with winfield and his architect in his auto to see 
how blue sea was getting on and to visit monied men who might be interested 
he drew up plans for ads and booklets making romantic sketches and originating catch lines 
in the next place after suzanne appeared he began to pay attention almost exclusively in 
his thoughts to her he could not get her out of his head night or 
day she haunted his thoughts in the office at home and in his dreams he 
began actually to burn with a strange fever which gave him no rest when would 
he see her again when would he see her again when would he see her 
again he could see her only as he danced with her at the boat club 
as he sat with her in the swing at daleview it was a wild aching 
desire which gave him no peace any more than any other fever of the brain 
ever does once not long after he and she had danced at the boat club 
together she came with her mother to see how angela was and eugene had a 
chance to say a few words to her in the studio for they came after 
five in the afternoon when he was at home suzanne gazed at him wideeyed scarcely 
knowing what to think though she was fascinated he asked her eagerly where she had 
been where she was going to be why she said gracefully her pretty lips parted 
we're going to bentwood hadley's tomorrow we'll be there for a week i fancy maybe 
longer have you thought of me much suzanne yes yes but you mustn't mr witla 
no no i don't know what to think if i came to bentwood hadleys would 
you be glad oh yes she said hesitatingly but you mustn't come eugene was there 
that weekend it wasn't difficult to manage i'm awfully tired he wrote to mrs hadley 
why don't you invite me out come came a telegram and he went on this 
occasion he was more fortunate than ever suzanne was there out riding when he came 
but as he learned from mrs hadley there was a dance on at a neighboring 
country club suzanne with a number of others was going mrs dale decided to go 
and invited eugene he seized the offer for he knew he would get a chance 
to dance with his ideal when they were going in to dinner he met suzanne 
in the hall i am going with you he said eagerly save a few dances 
for me yes she said inhaling her breath in a gasp they went and he 
initialled her card in five places we must be careful she pleaded mama won't like 
it he saw by this that she was beginning to understand and would plot with 
him why was he luring her on why did she let him when he slipped 
his arm about her in the first dance he said at last and then: i 
have waited for this so long suzanne made no reply look at me suzanne he 
pleaded i can't she said oh look at me he urged once please look in 
my eyes no no she begged i can't oh suzanne he exclaimed i am crazy 
about you i am mad i have lost all reason your face is like a 
flower to me your eyesi can't tell you about your eyes look at me no 
she pleaded it seems as though the days will never end in which i do 
not see you i wait and wait suzanne do i seem like a silly fool 
to you no i am counted sharp and able they tell me i am brilliant 
you are the most perfect thing that i have ever known i think of you 
awake and asleep i could paint a thousand pictures of you my art seems to 
come back to me through you if i live i will paint you in a 
hundred ways have you ever seen the rossetti woman no he painted a hundred portraits 
of her i shall paint a thousand of you she lifted her eyes to look 
at him shyly wonderingly drawn by this terrific passion his own blazed into hers oh 
look at me again he whispered when she dropped them under the fire of his 
glance i can't she pleaded oh yes once more she lifted her eyes and it 
seemed as though their souls would blend he felt dizzy and suzanne reeled do you 
love me suzanne he asked i don't know she trembled do you love me don't 
ask me now the music ceased and suzanne was gone he did not see her 
until much later for she slipped away to think her soul was stirred as with 
a raging storm it seemed as though her very soul was being torn up she 
was tremulous tumultuous unsettled yearning eager she came back after a time and they danced 
again but she was calmer apparently they went out on a balcony and he contrived 
to say a few words there you mustn't she pleaded i think we are being 
watched he left her and on the way home in the auto he whispered: i 
shall be on the west veranda tonight will you come i don't know i'll try 
he walked leisurely to that place later when all was still and sat down to 
wait gradually the great house quieted it was one and onethirty and then nearly two 
before the door opened a figure slipped out the lovely form of suzanne dressed as 
she had been at the ball a veil of lace over her hair i'm so 
afraid she said i scarcely know what i am doing are you sure no one 
will see us let us walk down the path to the field it was the 
same way they had taken in the early spring when he had met her here 
before in the west hung low a waning moon yellow sickle shaped very large because 
of the hour do you remember when we were here before yes i loved you 
then did you care for me no they walked on under the trees he holding 
her hand oh this night this night he said the strain of his intense emotion 
wearying him they came out from under the trees at the end of the path 
there was a sense of august dryness in the air it was warm sensuous about 
were the sounds of insects faint bumblings cracklings a tree toad chirped or a bird 
cried come to me suzanne he said at last when they emerged into the full 
light of the moon at the end of the path and paused come to me 
he slipped his arm about her no she said no look at me suzanne he 
pleaded i want to tell you how much i love you oh i have no 
words it seems ridiculous to try to tell you tell me that you love me 
suzanne tell me now i am crazy with love of you tell me no she 
said i can't kiss me no he drew her to him and turned her face 
up by her chin in spite of her open your eyes he pleaded oh god 
that this should come to me now i could die life can hold no more 
oh flower face oh silver feet oh myrtle bloom divine fire how perfect you are 
how perfect and to think you love me he kissed her eagerly kiss me suzanne 
tell me that you love me tell me oh how i love that name suzanne 
whisper to me you love me no but you do no look at me suzanne 
flower face myrtle bloom for god's sake look at me you love me oh yes 
yes yes she sobbed of a sudden throwing her arm around his neck oh yes 
yes don't cry he pleaded oh sweet don't cry i am mad for love of 
you mad kiss me now one kiss i am staking my soul on your love 
kiss me he pressed his lips to hers but she burst away terrorstricken oh i 
am so frightened she exclaimed all at once oh what shall i do i am 
so afraid oh please please something terrifies me something scares me oh what am i 
going to do let me go back she was white and trembling her hands were 
nervously clasping and unclasping eugene smoothed her arm soothingly be still suzanne he said be 
still i shall say no more you are all right i have frightened you we 
will go back be calm you are all right he recovered his own poise with 
an effort because of her obvious terror and led her back under the trees to 
reassure her he drew his cigar case from his pocket and pretended to select a 
cigar when he saw her calming he put it back are you quieter now sweet 
he asked tenderly yes but let us go back listen i will only go as 
far as the edge you go alone i will watch you safely to the door 
yes she said peacefully and you really love me suzanne oh yes but don't speak 
of it not tonight you will frighten me again let us go back they strolled 
on then he said: one kiss sweet in parting one life has opened anew for 
me you are the solvent of my whole being you are making me over into 
something different i feel as though i had never lived until now oh this experience 
it is such a wonderful thing to have doneto have lived through to have changed 
as i have changed you have changed me so completely made me over into the 
artist again from now on i can paint again i can paint you he scarcely 
knew what he was saying he felt as though he were revealing himself to himself 
as in an apocalyptic vision she let him kiss her but she was too frightened 
and wrought to even breathe right she was intense emotional strange she did not really 
understand what it was that he was talking about tomorrow he said at the wood's 
edge tomorrow sweet dreams i shall never know peace any more without your love and 
he watched her eagerly sadly bitterly ecstatically as she walked lightly from him disappearing like 
a shadow through the dark and silent door chapter vii it would be impossible to 
describe even in so detailed an account as this the subtleties vagaries beauties and terrors 
of the emotions which seized upon him and which by degrees began also to possess 
suzanne once he became wholly infatuated with her mrs dale was after a social fashion 
one of eugene's best friends she had since she had first come to know him 
spread his fame far and wide as an immensely clever publisher and editor an artist 
of the greatest power and a man of lovely and delightful ideas and personal worth 
he knew from various conversations with her that suzanne was the apple of her eye 
he had heard her talk had in fact discussed with her the difficulties of rearing 
a simple mannered innocentminded girl in present day society she had confided to him that 
it had been her policy to give suzanne the widest liberty consistent with goodbreeding and 
current social theories she did not want to make her bold or unduly selfreliant and 
yet she wanted her to be free and natural suzanne she was convinced from long 
observation and many frank conversations was innately honest truthful and cleanminded she did not understand 
her exactly for what mother can clearly understand any child but she thought she read 
her well enough to know that she was in some indeterminate way forceful and able 
like her father and that she would naturally gravitate to what was worth while in 
life had she any talent mrs dale really did not know the girl had vague 
yearnings toward something which was anything but social in its quality she did not care 
anything at all for most of the young men and women she met she went 
about a great deal but it was to ride and drive games of chance did 
not interest her drawingroom conversations were amusing to her but not gripping she liked interesting 
characters able books striking pictures she had been particularly impressed with those of eugene's she 
had seen and had told her mother that they were wonderful she loved poetry of 
high order and was possessed of a boundless appetite for the ridiculous and the comic 
an unexpected faux pas was apt to throw her into uncontrollable fits of laughter and 
the funny page selections of the current newspaper artists when she could obtain them amused 
her intensely she was a student of character and of her own mother and was 
beginning to see clearly what were the motives that were prompting her mother in her 
attitude toward herself quite as clearly as that person did herself and better at bottom 
she was more talented than her mother but in a different way she was not 
as yet as selfcontrolled or as understanding of current theories and beliefs as her mother 
but she was artistic emotional excitable in an intellectual way and capable of high flights 
of fancy and of intense and fine appreciations her really sensuous beauty was nothing to 
her she did not value it highly she knew she was beautiful and that men 
and boys were apt to go wild about her but she did not care they 
must not be so silly she thought she did not attempt to attract them in 
any way on the contrary she avoided every occasion of possible provocation her mother had 
told her plainly how susceptible men were how little their promises meant how careful she 
must be of her looks and actions in consequence she went her way as gaily 
and yet as inoffensively as she could trying to avoid the sadness of entrancing anyone 
hopelessly and wondering what her career was to be then eugene appeared with his arrival 
suzanne had almost unconsciously entered upon a new phase of her existence she had seen 
all sorts of men in society but those who were exclusively social were exceedingly wearisome 
to her she had heard her mother say that it was an important thing to 
marry money and some man of high social standing but who this man was to 
be and what he was to be like she did not know she did not 
look upon the typical society men she had encountered as answering suitably to the term 
high she had seen some celebrated wealthy men of influential families but they did not 
appear to her really human enough to be considered most of them were cold selfopinionated 
ultraartificial to her easy poetic spirit in the realms of real distinction were many men 
whom the papers constantly talked about financiers politicians authors editors scientists some of whom were 
in society she understood but most of whom were not she had met a few 
of them as a girl might most of those she met or saw were old 
and cold and paid no attention to her whatever eugene had appeared trailing an atmosphere 
of distinction and acknowledged ability and he was young he was good looking toolaughing and 
gay it seemed almost impossible at first to her that one so young and smiling 
should be so able as her mother said afterwards when she came to know him 
she began to feel that he was more than able that he could do anything 
he pleased she had visited him once in his office accompanied by her mother and 
she had been vastly impressed by the great building its artistic finish eugene's palatial surroundings 
surely he was the most remarkable young man she had ever known then came his 
incandescent attentions to her his glowing radiant presence and then eugene speculated deeply on how 
he should proceed all at once after this night the whole problem of his life 
came before him he was married he was highly placed socially better than he had 
ever been before he was connected closely with colfax so closely that he feared him 
for colfax in spite of certain emotional vagaries of which eugene knew was intensely conventional 
whatever he did was managed in the most offhand way and with no intention of 
allowing his home life to be affected or disrupted winfield whom also mrs dale knew 
was also conventional to outward appearances he had a mistress but she was held tightly 
in check he understood eugene had seen her at the new casino or a portion 
of it the east wing recently erected at blue sea and he had been greatly 
impressed with her beauty she was smart daring dashing eugene looked at her then wondering 
if the time would ever come when he could dare an intimacy of that character 
so many married men did would he ever attempt it and succeed now that he 
had met suzanne however he had a different notion of all this and it had 
come over him all at once heretofore in his dreams he had fancied he might 
strike up an emotional relationship somewhere which would be something like winfield's towards miss de 
kalb as she was known and so satisfy the weary longing that was in him 
for something new and delightful in the way of a sympathetic relationship with beauty since 
seeing suzanne he wanted nothing of this but only some readjustment or rearrangement of his 
life whereby he could have suzanne and suzanne only suzanne suzanne oh that dream of 
beauty how was he to obtain her how free his life of all save a 
beautiful relationship with her he could live with her forever and ever he could he 
could oh this vision this dream it was the sunday following the dance that suzanne 
and eugene managed to devise another day together which though it was one of those 
semiaccidental semivoiceless but nevertheless not wholly thoughtless coincidences which sometimes come about without being wholly 
agreed upon or understood in the beginning was nevertheless seized upon by them accepted silently 
and semiconsciously semiunconsciously worked out together had they not been very strongly drawn to each 
other by now this would not have happened at all but they enjoyed it none 
the less to begin with mrs dale was suffering from a sick headache the morning 
after in the next place kinroy suggested to his friends to go for a lark 
to south beach which was one of the poorest and scrubbiest of all the beaches 
on staten island in the next place mrs dale suggested that suzanne be allowed to 
go and that perhaps eugene would be amused she rather trusted him as a guide 
and mentor eugene said calmly that he did not object he was eager to be 
anywhere alone with suzanne and he fancied that some opportunity would present itself whereby once 
they were there they could be together but he did not want to show it 
once more the car was called and they departed being let off at one end 
of a silly panorama which stretched its shabby length for a mile along the shore 
the chauffeur took the car back to the house it being agreed that they could 
reach him by phone the party started down the plank walk but almost immediately because 
of different interests divided eugene and suzanne stopped to shoot at a shooting gallery next 
they stopped at a cane rack to ring canes anything was delightful to eugene which 
gave him an opportunity to observe his inamorata to see her pretty face her smile 
and to hear her heavenly voice she rung a cane for him every gesture of 
hers was perfection every look a thrill of delight he was walking in some elysian 
realm which had nothing to do with the tawdry evidence of life about him they 
followed the boardwalk southward after a ride in the devil's whirlpool for by now suzanne 
was caught in the persuasive subtlety of his emotion and could no more do as 
her honest judgment would have dictated than she could have flown it needed some shock 
some discovery to show her whither she was drifting and this was absent they came 
to a new dance hall where a few servant girls and their sweethearts were dancing 
and for a lark eugene proposed that they should enter they danced together again and 
though the surroundings were so poor and the music wretched eugene was in heaven let's 
run away and go to the terramarine he suggested thinking of a hotel farther south 
along the shore it is so pleasant there this is all so cheap where is 
it asked suzanne oh about three miles south of here we could almost walk there 
he looked down the long hot beach but changed his mind i don't mind this 
said suzanne it's so very bad that it's good you know i like to see 
how these people enjoy themselves but it is so bad argued eugene i wish i 
had your live healthy attitude toward things still we won't go if you don't want 
to suzanne paused thinking should she run away with him the others would be looking 
for them no doubt they were already wondering where they had gone still it didn't 
make so much difference her mother trusted her with eugene they could go well she 
said finally i don't care let's what will the others think he said doubtfully oh 
they won't mind she said when they're ready they'll call the car they know that 
i am with you they know that i can get the car when i want 
it mama won't mind eugene led the way back to a train which ran to 
hugenot their destination he was beside himself with the idea of a day all alone 
with suzanne he did not stay to consider or give ear to a thought concerning 
angela at home or how mrs dale would view it nothing would come of it 
it was not an outrageous adventure they took the train south and in a little 
while were in another world on the veranda of a hotel that overlooked the sea 
there were numerous autos of idlers like themselves in a court before the hotel there 
was a great grassy lawn with swings covered by striped awnings of red and blue 
and green and beyond that a pier with many little white launches anchored near the 
sea was as smooth as glass and great steamers rode in the distance trailing lovely 
plumes of smoke the sun was blazing hot brilliant but here on the cool porch 
waiters were serving pleasure lovers with food and drink a quartette of negroes were singing 
suzanne and eugene seated themselves in rockers at first to view the perfect day and 
later went down and sat in a swing unthinkingly without words these two were gradually 
gravitating toward each other under some spell which had no relationship to everyday life suzanne 
looked at him in the double seated swing where they sat facing each other and 
they smiled or jested aimlessly voicing nothing of all the upward welling deep that was 
stirring within was there ever such a day said eugene finally and in a voice 
that was filled with extreme yearning see that steamer out there it looks like a 
little toy yes said suzanne with a little gasp she inhaled her breath as she 
pronounced this word which gave it an airy breathlessness which had a touch of demure 
pathos in it oh it is perfect your hair he said you don't know how 
nice you look you fit this scene exactly don't speak of me she pleaded i 
look so tousled the wind in the train blew my hair so i ought to 
go the ladies' dressing room and hunt up a maid stay here said eugene don't 
go it is all so lovely i won't now i wish we might always sit 
here you just as you are there and i here did you ever read the 
'ode on a grecian urn' yes do you remember the lines 'fair youth beneath the 
trees thou canst not leave' yes yes she answered ecstatically 'bold lover never never canst 
thou kiss though winning near the goalyet do not grieve she cannot fade though thou 
hast not thy bliss for ever wilt thou love and she be fair' don't don't 
she pleaded he understood the pathos of that great thought was too much for her 
it hurt her as it did him what a mind they rocked and swung idly 
he pushing with his feet at times in which labor she joined him they strolled 
up the beach and sat down on a green clump of grass overlooking the sea 
idlers approached and passed he laid his arm to her waist and held her hand 
but something in her mood stayed him from any expression through dinner at the hotel 
it was the same and on the way to the train for she wanted to 
walk through the dark under some tall trees though in the rich moonlight prevailing he 
pressed her hand oh suzanne he said no no she breathed drawing back oh suzanne 
he repeated may i tell you no no she answered don't speak to me please 
don't let's just walk you and i he hushed for her voice though sad and 
fearsome was imperious he could not do less than obey this mood they went to 
a little country farmhouse which ranged along the track in lieu of a depot and 
sang a quaint air from some oldtime comic opera do you remember the first time 
when you came to play tennis with me he asked yes do you know i 
felt a strange vibration before your coming and all during your playing did you yes 
what is that suzanne i don't know don't you want to know no no mr 
witla not now mr witla it must be so oh suzanne let's just think she 
pleaded it is so beautiful they came to a station near daleview and walked over 
on the way he slipped his arm about her waist but oh so lightly suzanne 
he asked with a terrible yearning ache in his heart do you blame me can 
you don't ask me she pleaded not now no no he tried to press her 
a little more closely not now i don't blame you he stopped as they neared 
the lawn and entered the house with a jesting air explanations about mixing in the 
crowd and getting lost were easy mrs dale smiled good naturedly suzanne went to her 
room chapter viii having involved himself thus far seized upon and made his own this 
perfect flower of life eugene had but one thought and that was to retain it 
now of a sudden had fallen from him all the weariness of years to be 
in love again to be involved in such a love so wonderful so perfect so 
exquisite it did not seem that life could really be so gracious as to have 
yielded him so much what did it all mean his upward rise during all these 
years there had been seemingly but one triumph after another since the bitter days in 
riverwood and after the world summerfield's the kalvin company the united magazine corporation winfield his 
beautiful apartment on the drive surely the gods were good what did they mean to 
give him fame fortune and suzanne into the bargain could such a thing really be 
how could it be worked out would fate conspire and assist him so that he 
could be free of angelaor the thought of angela to him in these days was 
a great pain at bottom eugene really did not dislike her he never had years 
of living with her had produced an understanding and a relationship as strong and as 
keen as it might well be in some respects angela had always fancied since the 
riverwood days that she really did not love eugene truly any morecould not that he 
was too selfcentered and selfish but this on her part was more of an illusion 
than a reality she did care for him in an unselfish way from one point 
of view in that she would sacrifice everything to his interests from another point of 
view it was wholly selfish for she wanted him to sacrifice everything for her in 
return this he was not willing to do and had never been he considered that 
his life was a larger thing than could be encompassed by any single matrimonial relationship 
he wanted freedom of action and companionship but he was afraid of angela afraid of 
society in a way afraid of himself and what positive liberty might do to him 
he felt sorry for angelafor the intense suffering she would endure if he forced her 
in some way to release himand at the same time he felt sorry for himself 
the lure of beauty had never for one moment during all these years of upward 
mounting effort been stilled it is curious how things seem to conspire at times to 
produce a climax one would think that tragedies like plants and flowers are planted as 
seeds and grow by various means and aids to a terrible maturity roses of hell 
are some lives and they shine with all the lustre of infernal fires in the 
first place eugene now began to neglect his office work thoroughly for he could not 
fix his mind upon it any more than he could upon the affairs of the 
sea island company or upon his own home and angela's illness the morning after his 
south beach experience with suzanne and her curious reticence he saw her for a little 
while upon the veranda of daleview she was not seemingly depressed or at least not 
noticeably so and yet there was a gravity about her which indicated that a marked 
impression of some kind had been made upon her soul she looked at him with 
wide frank eyes as she came out to him purposely to tell him that she 
was going with her mother and some friends to tarrytown for the day i have 
to go she said mamma has arranged it by phone then i won't see you 
any more here no do you love me suzanne oh yes yes she declared and 
walked wearily to an angle of the wall where they could not be seen he 
followed her quickly cautiously kiss me he said and she put her lips to his 
in a distraught frightened way then she turned and walked briskly off and he admired 
the robust swinging of her body she was not tall like himself or small like 
angela but middle sized full bodied vigorous he imagined now that she had a powerful 
soul in her capable of great things full of courage and strength once she was 
a little older she would be very forceful and full of strong direct thought he 
did not see her again for nearly ten days and by that time he was 
nearly desperate he was wondering all the time how he was to arrange this he 
could not go on in this haphazard way seeing her occasionally why she might leave 
town for the fall a little later and then what would he do if her 
mother heard she would take her off to europe and then would suzanne forget what 
a tragedy that would be no before that should happen he would run away with 
her he would realize all his investments and get away he could not live without 
her he must have her at any cost what did the united magazine corporation amount 
to anyway he was tired of that work angela might have the sea island realty 
company's stock if he could not dispose of it advantageously or if he could he 
would make provision for her out of what he should receive he had some ready 
moneya few thousand dollars this and his arthe could still paintwould sustain them he would 
go to england with suzanne or to france they would be happy if she really 
loved him and he thought she did all this old life could go its way 
it was a dreary thing anyhow without love these were his first thoughts later he 
came to have different ones but this was after he had talked to suzanne again 
it was a difficult matter to arrange in a fit of desperation he called up 
daleview one day and asked if miss suzanne dale was there a servant answered and 
in answer to the who shall i say he gave the name of a young 
man that he knew suzanne knew when she answered he said: listen suzanne can you 
hear very well yes do you recognize my voice yes please don't pronounce my name 
will you no suzanne i am crazy to see you it has been ten days 
now are you going to be in town long i don't know i think so 
if anyone comes near you suzanne simply hang up the receiver and i will understand 
yes if i came anywhere near your house in a car could you come out 
and see me i don't know oh suzanne i'm not sure i'll try what time 
do you know where the old fort road is at crystal lake just below you 
yes do you know where the ice house is near the road there yes could 
you come there what time at eleven tomorrow morning or two this afternoon or three 
i might at two today oh thank you for that i'll wait for you anyhow 
all right goodbye and she hung up the receiver eugene rejoiced at the fortunate outcome 
of this effort without thinking at first of the capable manner in which she had 
handled the situation truly he said afterwards she must be very courageous to think so 
directly and act so quickly for it must have been very trying to her this 
love of his was so new her position was so very difficult and yet on 
this first call when she had been suddenly put in touch with him she had 
shown no signs of trepidation her voice had been firm and even much more so 
than his for he was nervously excited she had taken in the situation at once 
and fallen into the ruse quite readily was she as simple as she seemed yes 
and no she was simply capable he thought and her capability had acted through her 
simplicity instantly at two the same day eugene was there he gave as an excuse 
to his secretary that he was going out for a business conference with a wellknown 
author whose book he wished to obtain and calling a closed auto but one not 
his own journeyed to the rendezvous he asked the man to drive down the road 
making runs of half a mile to and fro while he sat in the shade 
of a clump of trees out of view of the road presently suzanne came bright 
and fresh as the morning beautiful in a light purple walking costume of masterly design 
she had on a large soft brimmed hat with long feathers of the same shade 
which became her exquisitely she walked with an air of grace and freedom and yet 
when he looked into her eyes he saw a touch of trouble there at last 
he said signaling her and smiling come in here my car is just up the 
road don't you think we had better get in it's closed we might be seen 
how long can you stay he took her in his arms and kissed her eagerly 
while she explained that she could not stay long she had said she was going 
to the library which her mother had endowed for a book she must be there 
by half past three or four at the least oh we can talk a great 
deal by then he said gaily here comes the car let's get in he looked 
cautiously about hailed it and they stepped in quickly as it drew up perth amboy 
said eugene and they were off at high speed once in the car all was 
perfect for they could not be seen he drew the shades partially and took her 
in his arms oh suzanne he said how long it has seemed how very long 
do you love me yes you know i do suzanne how shall we arrange this 
are you going away soon i must see you oftener i don't know she said 
i don't know what mama is thinking of doing i know she wants to go 
up to lenox in the fall oh pshaw commented eugene wearily listen mr witla said 
suzanne thoughtfully you know we are running a terrible risk what if mrs witla should 
find out or mama it would be terrible i know it said eugene i suppose 
i ought not to be acting in this way but oh suzanne i am wild 
about you i am not myself any longer i don't know what i am i 
only know that i love you love you love you he gathered her in his 
arms and kissed her ecstatically how sweet you look how beautiful you are oh flower 
face myrtle bloom angel eyes divine fire he hugged her in a long silent embrace 
the while the car sped on but what about us she asked wideeyed you know 
we are running a terrible risk i was just thinking this morning when you called 
me up it's dangerous you know are you becoming sorry suzanne no do you love 
me you know i do then you will help me figure this out i want 
to but listen mr witla now listen to me i want to tell you something 
she was very solemn and quaint and sweet in this mood i will listen to 
anything baby mine but don't call me mr witla call me eugene will you well 
now listen to me mrmreugene not mr eugene just eugene now say it eugene he 
quoted his own name to her now listen to me mrnow listen to me eugene 
she at last forced herself to say and eugene stopped her lips with his mouth 
there he said now listen to me she went on urgently you know i am 
afraid mama will be terribly angry if she finds this out oh will she interrupted 
eugene jocosely suzanne paid no attention to him we have to be very careful she 
likes you so much now that if she doesn't come across anything direct she will 
never think of anything she was talking about you only this morning what was she 
saying oh what a nice man you are and how able you are oh nothing 
like that replied eugene jestingly yes she did and i think mrs witla likes me 
i can meet you sometimes when i'm there but we must be so careful i 
mustn't stay out long today i want to think things out too you know i'm 
having a real hard time thinking about this eugene smiled her innocence was so delightful 
to him so naïve what do you mean by thinking things out suzanne asked eugene 
curiously he was interested in the workings of her young mind which seemed so fresh 
and wonderful to him it was so delightful to find this paragon of beauty so 
responsive so affectionate and helpful and withal so thoughtful she was somewhat like a delightful 
toy to him and he held her as reverently in awe as though she were 
a priceless vase you know i want to think what i'm doing i have to 
it seems so terrible to me at times and yet you know you know i 
know what he asked when she paused i don't know why i shouldn't if i 
want toif i love you eugene looked at her curiously this attempt at analysis of 
life particularly in relation to so trying and daring a situation as this astonished him 
he had fancied suzanne more or less thoughtless and harmless as yet big potentially but 
uncertain and vague here she was thinking about this most difficult problem almost more directly 
than he was and apparently with more courage he was astounded but more than that 
intensely interested what had become of her terrific fright of ten days before what was 
it she was thinking about exactly what a curious girl you are he said why 
am i she asked because you are i didn't think you could think so keenly 
yet i thought you would some day but how have you reasoned this out did 
you ever read 'anna karénina' she asked him meditatively yes he said wondering that she 
should have read it at her age what did you think of that oh it 
shows what happens as a rule when you fly in the face of convention he 
said easily wondering at the ability of her brain do you think things must happen 
that way no i don't think they must happen that way there are lots of 
cases where people do go against the conventions and succeed i don't know it appears 
to be all a matter of time and chance some do and some don't if 
you are strong enough or clever enough to 'get away with it' as they say 
you will if you aren't you won't what makes you ask well she said pausing 
her lips parted her eyes fixed on the floor i was thinking that it needn't 
necessarily be like that do you think it could be different yes it could be 
he said thoughtfully wondering if it really could because if it couldn't she went on 
the price would be too high it isn't worth while you mean you mean he 
said looking at her that you would he was thinking that she was deliberately contemplating 
making a sacrifice of herself for him something in her thoughtful selfdebating meditative manner made 
him think so suzanne looked out of the window and slowly nodded her head yes 
she said solemnly if it could be arranged why not i don't see why her 
face was a perfect blossom of beauty as she spoke eugene wondered whether he was 
waking or sleeping suzanne reasoning so suzanne reading anna karénina and philosophizing so basing a 
course of action on theorizing in connection with books and life and in the face 
of such terrible evidence as anna karénina presented to the contrary of this proposition would 
wonders ever cease you know she said after a time i think mama wouldn't mind 
eugene she likes you i've heard her say so lots of times besides i've heard 
her talk this way about other people she thinks people oughtn't to marry unless they 
love each other very much i don't think she thinks it's necessary for people to 
marry at all unless they want to we might live together if we wished you 
know eugene himself had heard mrs dale question the marriage system but only in a 
philosophic way he did not take much stock in her social maunderings he did not 
know what she might be privately saying to suzanne but he did not believe it 
could be very radical or at least seriously so don't you take any stock in 
what your mother says suzanne he observed studying her pretty face she doesn't mean it 
at least she doesn't mean it as far as you are concerned she's merely talking 
if she thought anything were going to happen to you she'd change her mind pretty 
quick no i don't think so replied suzanne thoughtfully you know i think i know 
mama better than she knows herself she always talks of me as a little girl 
but i can rule her in lots of things i've done it eugene stared at 
suzanne in amazement he could scarcely believe his ears she was beginning so early to 
think so deeply on the social and executive sides of life why should her mind 
be trying to dominate her mother's suzanne he observed you must be careful what you 
do or say don't rush into talking of this pellmell it's dangerous i love you 
but we shall have to go slow if mrs witla should learn of this she 
would be crazy if your mother should suspect she would take you away to europe 
somewhere very likely then i wouldn't get to see you at all oh no she 
wouldn't replied suzanne determinedly you know i know mama better than you think i do 
i can rule her i tell you i know i can i've done it she 
tossed her head in an exquisitely pretty way which upset eugene's reasoning faculties he could 
not think and look at her suzanne he said drawing her to him you are 
exquisite extreme the last word in womanhood for me to think of your reasoning soyou 
suzanne why why she asked with pretty parted lips and uplifted eyebrows why shouldn't i 
think oh yes certainly we all do but not so deeply necessarily flower face well 
we must think now she said simply yes we must think now he replied would 
you really share a studio with me if i were to take one i don't 
know of any other way quite at present i would if i knew how to 
manage it she replied mama is queer she's so watchful she thinks i'm a child 
and you know i am not at all i don't understand mama she talks one 
thing and does another i would rather do and not talk don't you think so 
he stared still i think i can fix it leave it to me and if 
you can you'll come to me oh yes yes exclaimed suzanne ecstatically turning to him 
all at once and catching his face between her hands ohshe looked into his eyes 
and dreamed but we must be careful he cautioned we musn't do anything rash i 
won't said suzanne and i won't of course he replied they paused again while he 
watched her i might make friends with mrs witla she observed after a time she 
likes me doesn't she yes said eugene mama doesn't object to my going up there 
and i could let you know that's all right do that said eugene oh please 
do if you can did you notice whose name i used today yes she said 
you know mr witla eugene i thought you might call me up did you he 
asked smiling yes you give me courage suzanne he said drawing close to her you're 
so confident so apparently carefree the world hasn't touched your spirit when i'm away from 
you though i'm not so courageous she replied i've been thinking terrible things i get 
frightened sometimes but you mustn't sweet i need you so oh how i need you 
she looked at him and for the first time smoothed his hair with her hand 
you know eugene you're just like a boy to me do i seem so he 
asked comforted greatly i couldn't love you as i do if you weren't he drew 
her to him again and kissed her anew can't we repeat these rides every few 
days he asked yes if i'm here maybe it's all right to call you up 
if i use another name yes i think so let's choose new names for each 
so that we'll know who's calling you shall be jenny lind and i allan poe 
then they fell to ardent lovemaking until the time came when they had to return 
for him so far as work was concerned the afternoon was gone chapter ix there 
followed now a series of meetings contrived with difficulty fraught with danger destructive of his 
peace of mind of his recently acquired sense of moral and commercial responsibility of the 
sense of singleness of purpose and interest in his editorial and publishing world which had 
helped him so much recently the meetings nevertheless were full of such intense bliss for 
him that it seemed as though he were a thousand times repaid for all the 
subtlety and folly he was practicing there were times when he came to the ice 
house in a hired car others when she notified him by phone or note to 
his office of times when she was coming in to town to stay he took 
her in his car one afternoon to blue sea when he was sure no one 
would encounter him he persuaded suzanne to carry a heavy veil which could be adjusted 
at odd moments another timeseveral in fact she came to the apartment in riverside drive 
ostensibly to see how mrs witla was getting along but really of course to see 
eugene suzanne did not really care so much for angela although she did not dislike 
her she thought she was an interesting woman though perhaps not a happy mate for 
eugene the latter had told her not so much that he was unhappy as that 
he was out of love he loved her now suzanne and only her the problem 
as to where this relationship was to lead to was complicated by another problem which 
eugene knew nothing of but which was exceedingly important for angela following the career of 
eugene with extreme pleasure and satisfaction on the commercial side and fear and distrust on 
the social and emotional sides had finally decided to risk the uncertain outcome of a 
child in connection with eugene and herself and to give him something which would steady 
his life and make him realize his responsibilities and offer him something gladdening besides social 
entertainment and the lure of beauty in youth she had never forgotten the advice which 
mrs sanifore and her physician had given her in philadelphia nor had she ever ceased 
her cogitations as to what the probable effect of a child would be eugene needed 
something of this sort to balance him his position in the world was too tenuous 
his temperament too variable a childa little girl she hoped for he always liked little 
girls and made much of themwould quiet him if she could only have a little 
girl now some two months before her illness while eugene was becoming all unsuspected by 
her so frenzied about suzanne she had relaxed or rather abandoned her oldtime precautions entirely 
and had recently begun to suspect that her fears or hopes or both were about 
to be realized owing to her subsequent illness and its effect on her heart she 
was not very happy now she was naturally very uncertain as to the outcome as 
well as to how eugene would take it he had never expressed a desire for 
a child but she had no thought of telling him as yet for she wanted 
to be absolutely sure if she were not correct in her suspicions and got well 
he would attempt to dissuade her for the future if she were he could not 
help himself like all women in that condition she was beginning to long for sympathy 
and consideration and to note more keenly the drift of eugene's mind toward a world 
which did not very much concern her his interest in suzanne had puzzled her a 
little though she was not greatly troubled about her because mrs dale appeared to be 
so thoughtful about her daughter times were changing eugene had been going out much alone 
a child would help it was high time it came when suzanne had started coming 
with her mother angela thought nothing of it but on the several occasions when suzanne 
called during her illness and eugene had been present she felt as though there might 
easily spring up something between them suzanne was so charming once as she lay thinking 
after suzanne had left the room to go into the studio for a few moments 
she heard eugene jesting with her and laughing keenly suzanne's laugh or gurgling giggle was 
most infectious it was so easy too for eugene to make her laugh for his 
type of jesting was to her the essence of fun it seemed to her that 
there was something almost overgay in the way they carried on on each occasion when 
she was present eugene proposed that he take suzanne home in his car and this 
set her thinking there came a time when angela being well enough from her rheumatic 
attack eugene invited a famous singer a tenor who had a charming repertoire of songs 
to come to his apartment and sing he had met him at a social affair 
in brooklyn with which winfield had something to do a number of people were invitedmrs 
dale suzanne and kinroy among others but mrs dale could not come and as suzanne 
had an appointment for the next morning sunday in the city she decided to stay 
at the witlas this pleased eugene immensely he had bought a sketching book which he 
had begun to fill with sketches of suzanne from memory and these he wanted to 
show her besides he wanted her to hear this singer's beautiful voice the company was 
interesting kinroy brought suzanne early and left eugene and suzanne after she had exchanged greetings 
with angela sat out on the little stone balcony overlooking the river and exchanged loving 
thoughts he was constantly holding her hand when no one was looking and stealing kisses 
after a time the company began to arrive and finally the singer himself the trained 
nurse with eugene's assistance helped angela forward who listened enraptured to the songs suzanne and 
eugene swept by the charm of some of them looked at each other with that 
burning gaze which love alone understands to eugene suzanne's face was a perfect flower of 
hypnotic influence he could scarcely keep his eyes off her for a moment at a 
time the singer ceased the company departed angela was left crying over the beauty of 
the erlking the last song rendered she went back to her room and suzanne ostensibly 
departed for hers she came out to say a few final words to mrs witla 
then came through the studio to go to her own room again eugene was there 
waiting he caught her in his arms kissing her silently they pretended to strike up 
a conventional conversation and he invited her to sit out on the stone balcony for 
a few last moments the moon was so beautiful over the river don't she said 
when he gathered her in his arms in the shadow of the night outside she 
might come no he said eagerly they listened but there was no sound he began 
an easy pretence to talk the while stroking her pretty arm which was bare insanity 
over her beauty the loveliness of the night the charm of the music had put 
him beside himself he drew her into his arms in spite of her protest only 
to have angela suddenly appear at the other end of the room where the door 
was there was no concealing anything she saw she came rapidly forward even as suzanne 
jumped up a sickening rage in her heart a sense of her personal condition strong 
in her mind a sense of something terrible and climacteric in the very air but 
she was still too ill to risk a great demonstration or to declare herself fully 
it seemed now once more the whole world had fallen about her ears for because 
of her plans and in spite of all her suspicions she had not been ready 
to believe that eugene would really trespass again she had come to surprise him if 
possible but she had not actually expected to had hoped not to here was this 
beautiful girl the victim of his wiles and here was she involved by her own 
planning while eugene shamefaced she supposed stood by ready to have this ridiculous liaison nipped 
in the bud she did not propose to expose herself to suzanne if she could 
help it but sorrow for herself shame for him pity for suzanne in a way 
the desire to preserve the shell of appearances which was now after this so utterly 
empty for her though so important for the child caused her to swell with her 
oldtime rage and yet to hold it in check six years before she would have 
raged to his face but time had softened her in this respect she did not 
see the value of brutal words suzanne she said standing erect in the filtered gloom 
of the room which was still irradiated by the light of the moon in the 
west how could you i thought so much better of you her face thinned by 
her long illness and her brooding over her present condition was still beautiful in a 
spiritual way she wore a pale yellow and white flowered dressing gown of filmy lacy 
texture and her long hair done in braids by the nurse was hanging down her 
back like the gretchen she was to him years before her hands were thin and 
pale but artistic and her face drawn in all the wearisome agony of a mater 
dolorosa why why exclaimed suzanne terribly shaken out of her natural fine poise for the 
moment but not forgetful of the dominating thought in her mind i love him that's 
why mrs witla oh no you don't you only think you love him as so 
many women have before you suzanne said angela frozenly the thought of the coming child 
always with her if she had only told him before oh shame in my house 
and you a young supposedly innocent girl what do you suppose your mother would think 
if i should call her up and tell her now or your brother you knew 
he was a married man i might excuse you if it weren't for that if 
you hadn't known me and hadn't accepted my hospitality as for him there is no 
need of my talking to him this is an old story with him suzanne he 
has done this with other women before you and he will do it with other 
women after you it is one of the things i have to bear for having 
married a man of socalled talent don't think suzanne when you tell me you love 
him that you tell me anything new i have heard that story before from other 
women you are not the first and you will not be the last suzanne looked 
at eugene inquiringly vaguely helplessly wondering if all this were so eugene hardened under angela's 
cutting accusation but he was not at all sure at first what he ought to 
do he wondered for the moment whether he ought not to abandon suzanne and fall 
back into his old state dreary as it might seem to him but the sight 
of her pretty face the sound of angela's cutting voice determined him quickly angela he 
began recovering his composure the while suzanne contemplated him why do you talk that way 
you know that what you say isn't true there was one other woman i will 
tell suzanne about her there were several before i married you i will tell her 
about them but my life is a shell and you know it this apartment is 
a shell absolutely it means nothing at all to me there has been no love 
between us certainly not on my part for years and you know that you have 
practically confessed to me from time to time that you do not care for me 
i haven't deceived this girl i am glad to tell her now how things stand 
how things stand how things stand exclaimed angela blazing and forgetting herself for the moment 
will you tell her what an excellent faithful husband you have made me will you 
tell her how honestly you have kept your word pledged to me at the altar 
will you tell her how i have worked and sacrificed for you through all these 
years how i have been repaid by just such things as this i'm sorry for 
you suzanne more than anything else went on angela wondering whether she should tell eugene 
here and now of her condition but fearing he would not believe it it seemed 
so much like melodrama you are just a silly little girl duped by an expert 
man who thinks he loves you for a little while but who really doesn't he 
will get over it tell me frankly what do you expect to get out of 
it all you can't marry him i won't give him a divorce i can't as 
he will know later and he has no grounds for obtaining one do you expect 
to be his mistress you have no hope of ever being anything else isn't that 
a nice ambition for a girl of your standing and you are supposed to be 
virtuous oh i am ashamed of you if you are not i am sorry for 
your mother i am astonished to think that you would so belittle yourself suzanne had 
heard the i can't but she really did not know how to interpret it it 
had never occurred to her that there could ever be a child here to complicate 
matters eugene told her that he was unhappy that there was nothing between him and 
angela and never could be but i love him mrs witla said suzanne simply and 
rather dramatically she was tense erect pale and decidedly beautiful it was a great problem 
to have so quickly laid upon her shoulders don't talk nonsense suzanne said angela angrily 
and desperately don't deceive yourself and stick to a silly pose you are acting now 
you're talking as you think you ought to talk as you have seen people talk 
in plays this is my husband you are in my home come get your things 
i will call up your mother and tell her how things stand and she will 
send her auto for you oh no said suzanne you can't do that i can't 
go back there if you tell her i must go out in the world and 
get something to do until i can straighten out my own affairs i won't be 
able to go home any more oh what shall i do be calm suzanne said 
eugene determinedly taking her hand and looking at angela defiantly she isn't going to call 
up your mother and she isn't going to tell your mother you are going to 
stay here as you intended and tomorrow you are going where you thought you were 
going oh no she isn't said angela angrily starting for the phone she is going 
home i'm going to call her mother suzanne stirred nervously eugene put his hand in 
hers to reassure her oh no you aren't he said determinedly she isn't going home 
and you are not going to touch that phone if you do a number of 
things are going to happen and they are going to happen quick he moved between 
her and the telephone receiver which hung in the hall outside the studio and toward 
which she was edging angela paused at the ominous note in his voice the determined 
quality of his attitude she was surprised and amazed at the almost rough manner in 
which he put her aside he had taken suzanne's hand he her husband and was 
begging her to be calm oh eugene said angela desperately frightened and horrified her anger 
half melted in her fears you don't know what you are doing suzanne doesn't she 
won't want anything to do with you when she does young as she is she 
will have too much womanhood what are you talking about asked eugene desperately he had 
no idea of what angela was driving at not the faintest suspicion what are you 
talking about he repeated grimly let me say just one word to you alone not 
here before suzanne just one and then perhaps you will be willing to let her 
go home tonight angela was subtle in this a little bit wicked she was not 
using her advantage in exactly the right spirit what is it demanded eugene sourly expecting 
some trick he had so long gnawed at the chains which bound him that the 
thought of any additional lengths which might be forged irritated him greatly why can't you 
tell it here what difference can it make it ought to make all the difference 
in the world let me say it to you alone suzanne who wondered what it 
could be walked away she was wondering what it was that angela had to tell 
the latter's manner was not exactly suggestive of the weighty secret she bore when suzanne 
was gone angela whispered to him it's a lie said eugene vigorously desperately hopelessly it's 
something you've trumped up for the occasion it's just like you to say that to 
do it pah i don't believe it it's a lie it's a lie you know 
it's a lie it's the truth said angela angrily pathetically outraged in her every nerve 
and thought by the reception which this fact had received and desperate to think that 
the announcement of a coming child by him should be received in this manner under 
such circumstances that it should be forced from her as a last resort only to 
be received with derision and scorn it's the truth and you ought to be ashamed 
to say that to me what can i expect from a man though who would 
introduce another woman into his own home as you have tonight to think that she 
should be reduced to such a situation as this so suddenly it was impossible to 
argue it with him here she was ashamed now that she had introduced it at 
this time he would not believe her anyhow now she saw that it only enraged 
him and her he was too wild this seemed to infuriate himto condemn her in 
his mind as a trickster and a sharper someone who was using unfair means to 
hold him he almost jumped away from her in disgust and she realized that she 
had struck an awful blow which apparently to him had some elements of unfairness in 
it won't you have the decency after this to send her away she pleaded aloud 
angrily eagerly bitterly eugene was absolutely in a fury of feeling if ever he thoroughly 
hated and despised angela he did so at that moment to think that she should 
have done anything like this to think that she should have complicated this problem of 
weariness of her with a thing like this how cheap it was how shabby it 
showed the measure of the woman to bring a child into the world regardless of 
the interests of the child in order to hold him against his will damn hell 
god damn such a complicated rotten world no she was lying she could not hold 
him that way it was a horrible low vile trick he would have nothing to 
do with her he would show her he would leave her he would show her 
that this sort of thing would not work with him it was like every other 
petty thing she had ever done never never never would he let this stand in 
the way oh what a mean cruel wretched thing to do suzanne came back while 
they were arguing she half suspected what it was all about but she did not 
dare to act or think clearly the events of this night were too numerous too 
complicated eugene had said so forcibly it was a lie whatever it was that she 
half believed him that was a sign surely of the little affection that existed between 
him and angela angela was not crying her face was hard white drawn i can't 
stay here said suzanne dramatically to eugene i will go somewhere i had better go 
to a hotel for the night will you call a car listen to me suzanne 
said eugene vigorously and determinedly you love me don't you you know i do she 
replied angela stirred sneeringly then you will stay here i want you to pay no 
attention to anything she may say or declare she has told me a lie tonight 
i know why don't let her deceive you go to your room and your bed 
i want to talk to you tomorrow there is no need of your leaving tonight 
there is plenty of room here it's silly you're here nowstay but i don't think 
i'd better stay said suzanne nervously eugene took her hand reassuringly listen to me he 
began but she won't stay said angela but she will said eugene and if she 
don't stay she goes with me i will take her home oh no you won't 
replied angela listen said eugene angrily this isn't six years ago but now i'm master 
of this situation and she stays here she stays here or she goes with me 
and you look to the future as best you may i love her i'm not 
going to give her up and if you want to make trouble begin now the 
house comes down on your head not mine oh said angela half terrified what do 
i hear just that now you go to your room suzanne will go to hers 
i will go to mine we will not have any more fighting here tonight the 
jig is up the die is cast i'm through suzanne comes to me if she 
will angela walked to her room through the studio stricken by the turn things had 
taken horrified by the thoughts in her mind unable to convince eugene unable to depose 
suzanne her throat dry and hot her hands shaking her heart beating fitfully she felt 
as if her brain would burst her heart break actually not emotionally she thought eugene 
had gone crazy and yet now for the first time in her married life she 
realized what a terrible mistake she had made in always trying to drive him it 
hadn't worked tonight her rage her domineering critical attitude it had failed her completely and 
also this scheme this beautiful plan this trump card on which she had placed so 
much reliance for a happy life this child which she had hoped to play so 
effectively he didn't believe her he wouldn't even admit its possibility he didn't admire her 
for it he despised her he looked on it as a trick oh what an 
unfortunate thing it had been to mention it and yet suzanne must understand she must 
know she would never countenance anything like this but what would he do he was 
positively livid with rage what fine auspices these were under which to usher a child 
into the world she stared feverishly before her and finally began to cry hopelessly eugene 
stood in the hall beside suzanne after she had gone his face was drawn his 
eyes hunted his hair tousled he looked grim and determined in his way stronger than 
he had ever looked before suzanne he said taking the latter by her two arms 
and staring into her eyes she has told me a lie a lie a cold 
mean cruel lie she'll tell it you shortly she says she is with child by 
me it isn't so she couldn't have one if she did it would kill her 
she would have had one long ago if she could have i know her she 
thinks this will frighten me she thinks it will drive you away will it it's 
a lie do you hear me whatever she says it's a lie and she knows 
it ough he dropped her left arm and pulled at his neck i can't stand 
this you won't leave me you won't believe her will you suzanne stared into his 
distraught face his handsome desperate significant eyes she saw the woe there the agony and 
was sympathetic he seemed wonderfully worthy of love unhappy unfortunately pursued and yet she was 
frightened still she had promised to love him no she said fixedly her eyes speaking 
a dramatic confidence you won't leave here tonight no she smoothed his cheek with her 
hand you will come and walk with me in the morning i have to talk 
with you yes don't be afraid just lock your door if you are she won't 
bother you she won't do anything she is afraid of me she may want to 
talk with you but i am close by do you still love me yes will 
you come to me if i can arrange it yes even in the face of 
what she says yes i don't believe her i believe you what difference could it 
make anyhow you don't love her no he said no no no i never have 
he drew her into his arms wearily relievedly oh flower face he said don't give 
me up don't grieve try not to anyhow i have been bad as she says 
but i love you i love you and i will stake all on that if 
all this must fall about our heads then let it fall i love you suzanne 
stroked his cheek with her hands nervously she was deathly pale frightened but somehow courageous 
through it all she caught strength from his love i love you she said yes 
he replied you won't give me up no i won't she said not really understanding 
the depth of her own mood i will be true things will be better tomorrow 
he said somewhat more quietly we will be calmer we will walk and talk you 
won't leave without me no please don't for i love you and we must talk 
and plan chapter x the introduction of this astonishing fact in connection with angela was 
so unexpected so morally diverting and peculiar that though eugene denied it half believed she 
was lying he was harassed by the thought that she might be telling the truth 
it was so unfair though was all he could think so unkind it never occurred 
to him that it was accidental as indeed it was not but only that it 
was a trick sharp cunning illtimed for him just the thing calculated to blast his 
career and tie him down to the old régime when he wanted most to be 
free a new life was dawning for him now for the first time in his 
life he was to have a woman after his own heart so young so beautiful 
so intellectual so artistic with suzanne by his side he was about to plumb the 
depths of all the joys of living without her life was to be dark and 
dreary and here was angela coming forward at the critical moment disrupting this dream as 
best she could by the introduction of a child that she did not want and 
all to hold him against his will if ever he hated her for trickery and 
sharp dealing he did so now what would the effect on suzanne be how would 
he convince her that it was a trick she must understand she would she would 
not let this miserable piece of chicanery stand between him and her he turned in 
his bed wearily after he had gone to it but he could not sleep he 
had to say something do something so he arose slipped on a dressing gown and 
went to angela's room that distraught soul for all her determination and fighting capacity was 
enduring for the second time in her life the fires of hell to think that 
in spite of all her work her dreams this recent effort to bring about peace 
and happiness perhaps at the expense of her own life she was compelled to witness 
a scene like this eugene was trying to get free he was obviously determined to 
do so this scandalous relationship when had it begun would her effort to hold him 
fail it looked that way and yet surely suzanne when she knew when she understood 
would leave him any woman would her head ached her hands were hot she fancied 
she might be suffering a terrible nightmare she was so sick and weak but no 
this was her room a little while ago she was sitting in her husband's studio 
surrounded by friends the object of much solicitude eugene apparently considerate and thoughtful of her 
a beautiful programme being rendered for their special benefit now she was lying here in 
her room a despised wife an outcast from affection and happiness the victim of some 
horrible sorcery of fate whereby another woman stood in her place in eugene's affection to 
see suzanne proud in her young beauty confronting her with bold eyes holding her husband's 
hand saying in what seemed to her to be brutal or insane or silly melodramatic 
makebelieve but i love him mrs witla was maddening oh god oh god would her 
tortures never cease must all her beautiful dreams come to nothing would eugene leave her 
as he so violently said a little while ago she had never seen him like 
this it was terrible to see him so determined so cold and brutal his voice 
had actually been harsh and guttural something she had never known before in him she 
trembled as she thought and then great flashes of rage swept her only to be 
replaced by rushes of fear she was in such a terrific position the woman was 
with him young defiant beautiful she had heard him call to her had heard them 
talking once she thought that now would be the time to murder him suzanne herself 
the coming life and end it all but at this critical moment having been sick 
and having grown so much older with this problem of the coming life before her 
she had no chart to go by she tried to console herself with the thought 
that he must abandon his course that he would when the true force of what 
she had revealed had had time to sink home but it had not had time 
yet would it before he did anything rash would it before he had completely compromised 
himself and suzanne judging from her talk and his he had not as yet or 
she thought not what was he going to do what was he going to do 
angela feared as she lay there that in spite of her revelation he might really 
leave her immediately there might readily spring a terrible public scandal out of all this 
the mockery of their lives laid bare the fate of the child jeopardized eugene suzanne 
and herself disgraced though she had little thought for suzanne suzanne might get him after 
all she might accidentally be just hard and cold enough the world might possibly forgive 
him she herself might die what an end after all her dreams of something bigger 
better surer oh the pity the agony of this the terror and horror of a 
wrecked life and then eugene came into the room he was haggard stormyeyed thoughtful melancholy 
as he entered he stood in the doorway first intent then clicked a little nightlamp 
button which threw on a very small incandescent light near the head of angela's bed 
and then sat down in a rockingchair which the nurse had placed near the medicine 
table angela had so much improved that no night nurse was neededonly a twelvehour one 
well he said solemnly but coldly when he saw her pale distraught much of her 
old youthful beauty still with her you think you have scored a splendid trick don't 
you you think you have sprung a trap i simply came in here to tell 
you that you haven'tthat you have only seen the beginning of the end you say 
you are going to have a child i don't believe it it's a lie and 
you know it's a lie you saw that there was an end coming to all 
this state of weariness some time and this is your answer well you've played one 
trick too many and you've played it in vain you lose i win this time 
i'm going to be free now i want to say to you and i am 
going to be free if i have to turn everything upside down i don't care 
if there were seventeen prospective children instead of one it's a lie in the first 
place but if it isn't it's a trick and i'm not going to be tricked 
any longer i've had all i want of domination and trickery and cheap ideas i'm 
through now do you hear me i'm through he felt his forehead with a nervous 
hand his head ached he was half sick this was such a dreary pit to 
find himself in this pit of matrimony chained by a domineering wife and a trickily 
manoeuvred child his child what a mockery at this stage of his life how he 
hated the thought of that sort of thing how cheap it all seemed angela who 
was wideeyed flushed exhausted lying staring on her pillow asked in a weary indifferent voice: 
what do you want me to do eugene leave you i'll tell you angela he 
said sepulchrally i don't know what i want you to do just at this moment 
the old life is all over it's as dead as dead can be for eleven 
or twelve years now i have lived with you knowing all the while that i 
was living a lie i have never really loved you since we were married you 
know that i may have loved you in the beginning yes i did and at 
blackwood but that was a long long while ago i never should have married you 
it was a mistake but i did and i've paid for it inch by inch 
you have too you have insisted all along that i ought to love you you 
have browbeaten and abused me for something i could no more do than i could 
fly now at this last minute you introduce a child to hold me i know 
why you have done it you imagine that in some way you have been appointed 
by god to be my mentor and guardian well i tell you now that you 
haven't it's all over if there were fifty children it's all over suzanne isn't going 
to believe any such cheap story as that and if she did she wouldn't leave 
me she knows why you do it all the days of weariness are over for 
me all the days of being afraid i'm not an ordinary man and i'm not 
going to live an ordinary life you have always insisted on holding me down to 
the little cheap conventions as you have understood them out in wisconsin out in blackwood 
nothing doing it's all over from now on everything's over this house my job my 
real estate dealeverything i don't care what your condition is i love this girl in 
there and i'm going to have her do you hear me i love her and 
i'm going to have her she's mine she suits me i love her and no 
power under god is going to stay me now you think this child proposition you 
have fixed up is going to stay me but you are going to find out 
that it can't that it won't it's a trick and i know it and you 
know it it's too late it might have last year or two years ago or 
three but it won't work now you have played your last card that girl in 
there belongs to me and i'm going to have her again he smoothed his face 
in a weary way pausing to sway the least bit in his chair his teeth 
were set his eyes hard consciously he realized that it was a terrible situation that 
confronted him hard to wrestle with angela gazed at him with the eyes of one 
who is not quite sure that she even sees aright she knew that eugene had 
developed he had become stronger more urgent more defiant during all these years in which 
he had been going upward he was no more like the eugene who had clung 
to her for companionship in the dark days at biloxi and elsewhere than a child 
is like a grown man he was harder easier in his manner more indifferent and 
yet until now there had never been a want of traces of the old eugene 
what had become of them so suddenly why was he so raging so bitter this 
girl this foolish silly selfish girl with her circe gift of beauty by tolerance of 
his suit by yielding perhaps by throwing herself at eugene's head had done this thing 
she had drawn him away from her in spite of the fact that they had 
appeared to be happily mated suzanne did not know that they were not in this 
mood he might actually leave her even as she was with child it depended on 
the girl unless she could influence her unless she could bring pressure to bear in 
some way eugene might readily be lost to her and then what a tragedy she 
could not afford to have him go now why in six months she shivered at 
the thought of all the misery a separation would entail his position their child society 
this apartment dear god it would drive her crazy if he were to desert her 
now oh eugene she said quite sadly and without any wrath in her voice at 
this moment for she was too torn terrified and disheveled in spirit to feel anything 
save a haunting sense of fear you don't know what a terrible mistake you are 
making i did do this thing on purpose eugene it is true long ago in 
philadelphia with mrs sanifore i went to a physician to see if it were possible 
that i might have a child you know that i always thought that i couldn't 
well he told me that i could i went because i thought that you needed 
something like that eugene to balance you i knew you didn't want one i thought 
you would be angry when i told you i didn't act on it for a 
long while i didn't want one myself i hoped that it might be a little 
girl if ever there was one because i know that you like little girls it 
seems silly now in the face of what has happened tonight i see what a 
mistake i have made i see what the mistake is but i didn't mean it 
evilly eugene i didn't i wanted to hold you to bind you to me in 
some way to help you do you utterly blame me eugene i'm your wife you 
know he stirred irritably and she paused scarcely knowing how to go on she could 
see how terribly irritated he was how sick at heart and yet she resented this 
attitude on his part it was so hard to endure when all along she had 
fancied that she had so many just claims on him moral social other claims which 
he dare not ignore here she was now sick weary pleading with him for something 
that ought justly be hersand this coming child's oh eugene she said quite sadly and 
still without any wrath in her voice please think before you make a mistake you 
don't really love this girl you only think you do you think she is beautiful 
and good and sweet and you are going to tear everything up and leave me 
but you don't love her and you are going to find it out you don't 
love anyone eugene you can't you are too selfish if you had any real love 
in you some of it would have come out to me for i have tried 
to be all that a good wife should be but it has been all in 
vain i've known you haven't liked me all these years i've seen it in your 
eyes eugene you have never come very close to me as a lover should unless 
you had to or you couldn't avoid me you have been cold and indifferent and 
now that i look back i see that it has made me so i have 
been cold and hard i've tried to steel myself to match what i thought was 
your steeliness and now i see what it has done for me i'm sorry but 
as for her you don't love her and you won't she's too young she hasn't 
any ideas that agree with yours you think she's soft and gentle and yet big 
and wise but do you think if she had been that she could have stood 
up there as she did tonight and looked me in the eyesme your wifeand told 
me that she loved youyou my husband do you think if she had any shame 
she would be in there now knowing what she does for i suppose you have 
told her what kind of a girl is that anyway you call her good good 
would a good girl do anything like that what is the use of arguing by 
appearances asked eugene who had interrupted her with exclamations of opposition and bitter comments all 
through the previous address the situation is one which makes anything look bad she didn't 
intend to be put in a position where she would have to tell you that 
she loved me she didn't come here to let me make love to her in 
this apartment i made love to her she's in love with me and i made 
her love me i didn't know of this other thing if i had it wouldn't 
have made any difference however let that be as it will so it is i'm 
in love with her and that's all there is to it angela stared at the 
wall she was half propped up on a pillow and had no courage now to 
speak of and no fighting strength i know what it is with you eugene she 
said after a time it's the yoke that galls it isn't me only it's anyone 
it's marriage you don't want to be married it would be the same with any 
woman who might ever have loved and married you or with any number of children 
you would want to get rid of her and them it's the yoke that galls 
you eugene you want your freedom and you won't be satisfied until you have it 
a child wouldn't make any difference i can see that now i want my freedom 
he exclaimed bitterly and inconsiderately and what's more i'm going to have it i don't 
care i'm sick of lying and pretending sick of common little piffling notions of what 
you consider right and wrong for eleven or twelve years now i have stood it 
i have sat with you every morning at breakfast and every evening at dinner most 
of the time when i didn't want to i have listened to your theories of 
life when i didn't believe a word of what you said and didn't care anything 
about what you thought i've done it because i thought i ought to do it 
so as not to hurt your feelings but i'm through with all that what have 
i had spying on me opposition searching my pockets for letters complaining if i dared 
to stay out a single evening and did not give an account of myself why 
didn't you leave me after that affair at riverdale why do you hang on to 
me when i don't love you one'd think i was prisoner and you my keeper 
good christ when i think of it it makes me sick well there's no use 
worrying over that any more it's all over it's all beautifully over and i'm done 
with it i'm going to live a life of my own hereafter i'm going to 
carve out some sort of a career that suits me i'm going to live with 
someone that i can really love and that's the end of it now you run 
and do anything you want to he was like a young horse that had broken 
rein and that thinks that by rearing and plunging he shall become forever free he 
was thinking of green fields and delightful pastures he was free now in spite of 
what she had told him this night had made him so and he was going 
to remain free suzanne would stand by him he felt it he was going to 
make it perfectly plain to angela that never again come what may would things be 
as they were yes eugene she replied sadly after listening to his protestations on this 
score i think that you do want your freedom now that i see you i'm 
beginning to see what it means to you but i have made such a terrible 
mistake are you thinking about me at all what shall i do it is true 
that there will be a child unless i die i may die i'm afraid of 
that or i was i am not now the only reason i would care to 
live would be to take care of it i didn't think i was going to 
be ill with rheumatism i didn't think my heart was going to be affected in 
this way i didn't think that you were going to do as you have done 
but now that you have nothing matters oh she said sadly hot tears welling to 
her eyes it is all such a mistake if i only hadn't done this eugene 
stared at the floor he wasn't softened one bit he did not think she was 
going to dieno such luck he was thinking that this merely complicated things or that 
she might be acting but that it could not stand in his way why had 
she tried to trick him in this way it was her fault now she was 
crying but that was the old hypocrisy of emotion that she had used so often 
he did not intend to desert her absolutely she would have plenty to live on 
merely he did not propose to live with her if he could help it or 
only nominally anyhow the major portion of his time should be given to suzanne i 
don't care what it costs he said finally i don't propose to live with you 
i didn't ask you to have a child it was none of my doing you're 
not going to be deserted financially but i'm not going to live with you he 
stirred again and angela stared hotcheeked the hardness of the man enraged her for the 
moment she did not believe that she would starve but their improving surroundings their home 
their social position would be broken up completely yes yes i understand she pleaded with 
an effort at controlling herself but i am not the only one to be considered 
are you thinking of mrs dale and what she may do and say she isn't 
going to let you take suzanne if she knows it without doing something about it 
she is an able woman she loves suzanne however selfwilled she may be she likes 
you now but how long do you think she is going to like you when 
she learns what you want to do with her daughter what are you going to 
do with her you can't marry her under a year even if i were willing 
to give you a divorce you could scarcely get a divorce in that time i'm 
going to live with her that's what i'm going to do declared eugene she loves 
me she's willing to take me just as i am she doesn't need marriage ceremonies 
and rings and vows and chains she doesn't believe in them as long as i 
love her all right when i cease to love her she doesn't want me any 
more some difference in that isn't there he added bitterly it doesn't sound exactly like 
blackwood does it angela bridled his taunts were cruel she says that eugene she replied 
quietly but she hasn't had time to think you've hypnotized her for the moment she's 
fascinated when she stops to think later if she has any sense any pride but 
oh why should i talk you won't listen you won't think then she added: but 
what do you propose to do about mrs dale don't you suppose she will fight 
you even if i do not i wish you would stop and think eugene this 
is a terrible thing you are doing think think he exclaimed savagely and bitterly as 
though i had not been thinking all these years think hell i haven't done anything 
but think i've thought until the soul within me is sick i've thought until i 
wish to god i could stop i've thought about mrs dale don't you worry about 
her i'll settle this matter with her later just now i want to convince you 
of what i am going to do i'm going to have suzanne and you're not 
going to stop me oh eugene sighed angela if something would only make you see 
it is partially my fault i have been hard and suspicious and jealous but you 
have given me some cause to be don't you think i see now that i 
have made a mistake i have been too hard and too jealous but i could 
reform if you would let me try she was thinking now of living not dying 
i know i could you have so much to lose is this change worth it 
you know so well how the world looks at these things why even if you 
should obtain your freedom from me under the circumstances what do you suppose the world 
would think you couldn't desert your child why not wait and see what happens i 
might die there have been such cases then you would be free to do as 
you pleased that is only a little way off it was a specious plea calculated 
to hold him but he saw through it nothing doing he exclaimed in the slang 
of the day i know all about that i know what you're thinking in the 
first place i don't believe you are in the condition you say you are in 
the next place you're not going to die i don't propose to wait to be 
free i know you and i've no faith in you what i do needn't affect 
your condition you're not going to starve no one need know unless you start a 
row about it suzanne and i can arrange this between ourselves i know what you're 
thinking but you're not going to interfere if you do i'll smash everything in sightyou 
this apartment my job he clenched his hands desperately determinedly angela's hands were tingling with 
nervous pains while eugene talked her eyes ached and her heart fluttered she could not 
understand this dark determined man so savage and so resolute in his manner was this 
eugene who was always moving about quietly when he was near her getting angry at 
times but always feeling sorry and apologizing she had boasted to some of her friends 
and particularly to marietta in a friendly jesting way that she could wind eugene around 
her little finger he was so easygoing in the main so quiet here he was 
a raging demon almost possessed of an evil spirit of desire and tearing up his 
and hers and suzanne's life for that matter by the roots she did not care 
for suzanne though now or mrs dale her own blighted life and eugene's looming so 
straight ahead of her terrified her what do you suppose mr colfax will do when 
he hears of this she asked desperately hoping to frighten him i don't care a 
damn what mr colfax will or can do he replied sententiously i don't care a 
damn what anybody does or says or thinks i love suzanne dale she loves me 
she wants me there's an end of that i'm going to her now you stay 
me if you can suzanne dale suzanne dale how that name enraged and frightened angela 
never before had she witnessed quite so clearly the power of beauty suzanne dale was 
young and beautiful she was looking at her only tonight thinking how fascinating she washow 
fair her faceand here was eugene bewitched by it completely undone oh the terror of 
beauty the terror of social life generally why had she entertained why become friendly with 
the dales but then there were other personalities almost as lovely and quite as youngmarjorie 
mclennan florence reel henrietta tenman annette kean it might have been any one of these 
she couldn't have been expected to shut out all young women from eugene's life no 
it was eugene it was his attitude toward life his craze about the beautiful particularly 
in women she could see it now he really was not strong enough beauty would 
always upset him at critical moments she had seen it in relation to herselfthe beauty 
of her form which he admired so or had admired god she prayed silently give 
me wisdom now give me strength i don't deserve it but help me help me 
to save him help me to save myself oh eugene she said aloud hopelessly i 
wish you would stop and think i wish you would let suzanne go her way 
in the morning and you stay sane and calm i won't care about myself i 
can forgive and forget i'll promise you i'll never mention it if a child comes 
i'll do my best not to let it annoy you i'll try yet not to 
have one it may not be too late i'll change from this day forth oh 
she began to cry no by god he said getting up no no no i'm 
through now i'm through i've had enough of fake hysterics and tears tears one minute 
and wrath and hate the next subtlety subtlety subtlety nothing doing you've been master and 
jailer long enough it's my turn now i'll do a little jailing and tasksetting for 
a change i'm in the saddle and i'm going to stay there you can cry 
if you want to you can do what you please about the child i'm through 
i'm tired and i'm going to bed but this thing is going to stand just 
as it does i'm through and that's all there is to it he strode out 
of the room angrily and fiercely but nevertheless when he reached it he sat in 
his own room which was on the other side of the studio from angelas and 
did not sleep his mind was on fire with the thought of suzanne he thought 
of the old order which had been so quickly and so terribly broken now if 
he could remain master and he could he proposed to take suzanne she would come 
to him secretly no doubt if necessary they would open a studio a second establishment 
angela might not give him a divorce if what she said was true she couldn't 
he wouldn't want her to but he fancied from this conversation that she was so 
afraid of him that she would not stir up any trouble there was nothing she 
could really do he was in the saddle truly and would stay there he would 
take suzanne would provide amply for angela would visit all those lovely public resorts he 
had so frequently seen and he and suzanne would be happy together suzanne suzanne oh 
how beautiful she was and to think how nobly and courageously she had stood by 
him tonight how she had slipped her hand into his so sweetly and had said 
but i love him mrs witla yes she loved him no doubt of that she 
was young exquisite beautifully rounded in her budding emotion and feeling she was going to 
develop into a wonderful woman a real one and she was so young what a 
pity it was he was not free now well wait this would right all things 
and meanwhile he would have her he must talk to suzanne he must tell her 
how things stood poor little suzanne there she was in her room wondering what was 
to become of her and here was he well he couldn't go to her tonight 
it did not look right and besides angela might fight still but tomorrow tomorrow oh 
tomorrow he would walk and talk with her and they would plan tomorrow he would 
show her just what he wanted to do and find out what she could do 
chapter xi this night passed without additional scenes though as it stood it was the 
most astonishing and tremendous in all eugene's experience he had not up to the time 
angela walked into the room really expected anything so dramatic and climacteric to happen though 
what he did expect was never really very clear to him at times as he 
lay and thought now he fancied that he might eventually have to give suzanne up 
though how or when or why he could not say he was literally crazed by 
her and could not think that such a thing could really be at other moments 
he fancied that powers outside of this visible life the life attested by the five 
senses had arranged this beautiful finish to his career for him so that he might 
be perfectly happy all his life he had fancied that he was leading a more 
or less fated life principally more he thought that his art was a gift that 
he had in a way been sent to revolutionize art in america or carry it 
one step farther forward and that nature was thus constantly sending its apostles or special 
representatives over whom it kept watch and in whom it was well pleased at other 
times he fancied he might be the sport or toy of untoward and malicious powers 
such as those which surrounded and accomplished macbeth's tragic end and which might be intending 
to make an illustration of him as he looked at life at times it seemed 
to do this with certain people the fates lied lovely blandishing lures were held out 
only to lead men to destruction he had seen other men who seemed to have 
been undone in this way was he to be so treated angela's unexpected and peculiar 
announcement made it look that way still he did not believe it life had sent 
suzanne across his path for a purpose the fates or powers had seen he was 
miserable and unhappy being a favorite child of heaven he was to be rewarded for 
his sufferings by having her she was here nowquickly forcefully thrust into his arms so 
to speak so that perhaps he might have her all the more quickly how silly 
it seemed to him now to have brought her into his own apartment to make 
love to her and get caught and yet how fortunate too the hand of fate 
no doubt it was intended anyhow the shame to him the shame to angela and 
suzanne the terrific moments and hours that each was enduring nowthese were things which were 
unfortunately involved in any necessarily great readjustment it was probable that it had to come 
about this way it was better so than to go on living an unhappy life 
he was really fitted for something better he thoughta great career he would have to 
adjust this thing with angela in some way now either leave her or make some 
arrangement whereby he could enjoy the company of suzanne uninterrupted there must be no interference 
he did not propose to give her up the child might come well and good 
he would provide for it that would be all he recalled now the conversation he 
had had with suzanne in which she had said that she would live with him 
if she could the time had come their plan for a studio should now be 
put into effect it must be secret angela would not care she could not help 
herself if only the events of this night did not terrorize suzanne into retracing her 
steps he had not explained to her how he was to get rid of angela 
apart from what she had heard this night she was thinking he knew that they 
could go on loving each other in this tentative fashion occupying a studio together perhaps 
not caring what the world thought not caring what her mother thought ignoring her brother 
and sister and angela and being happy with eugene only he had never tried to 
disillusion her he was not thinking clearly himself he was rushing forward in an aimless 
way desiring the companionship of her beautiful mind and body now he saw he must 
act or lose her he must convince her in the face of what angela had 
said or let her go she would probably be willing to come to him rather 
than leave him entirely he must talk explain make her understand just what a trick 
this all was angela had not slept but lay staring at the ceiling in the 
dark her eyes a study in despair when morning came they were none of them 
further along in their conclusions than they were the night before save to know each 
separately and distinctly that a great tragedy or change was at hand suzanne had thought 
and thought or tried to but the impulse of blood and passion in her were 
eugeneward and she could only see the situation from their own point of view she 
loved him she thoughtmust love him since he was so ready to sacrifice so much 
for her yet at the same time there was a strange disconcerting nebulosity about her 
which had eugene fully realized it at this moment would have terrified him in her 
state which was one of wondering delight at the beauty of life and lovea fatalistic 
security in the thought that joy was to come to her throughout lifemuch joy she 
could not see the grimness of eugene's position she could not understand the agony of 
a soul that had never really tasted supreme bliss in love and had wanted however 
foolishly the accessories of wealth and had never had them terrorized lest after the first 
sip of so wonderful a joy it should be removed forever eugene was tingling in 
the dark of his own roomtingling and yet reaching almost with outstretched hands to the 
splendor of the life that was seemingly before him suzanne however to whom life had 
given so much was resting in a kind of still ease like that which might 
fill a drowsy poppyland of joy where all the pleasures had been attained and were 
being tasted at leisure life at its worst to her was not so bad witness 
this storm which had been quelled in part by eugene and was like to blow 
over as nothing at all things came round of their own accord in time if 
one let them she had always felt so sure that whatever happened no ill would 
befall her and here she was courted and protected by eugene even in his own 
home in this situation therefore she was not grieving either for eugene for angela or 
for herself she could not some dispositions are so eugene was able to take care 
of himself and her and angela financially she thought she was really looking forward to 
that better day when this misalliance should be broken up and eugene and presumably angela 
would be really happier she wanted eugene to be much happier and angela for that 
matterand through her if possible since eugene's happiness seemed to depend on her but unlike 
eugene she was already thinking that she could live well enough without him if it 
must be she did not want to she felt that her greatest happiness would be 
in repaying him for past ills and pains but if they must part for a 
time for instance it would not make so much difference time would bring them together 
but if it didn't but it would why think otherwise but how wonderful it was 
that her beauty her mere physical beauty which seemed unimportant to her made him so 
wild she could not know of the actual physical pain gnawing at his vitals but 
it was so plain that he was madly stricken with her his whole face and 
his burning black eyes riveted on her in intense delight and almost agony proved it 
was she so beautiful surely not yet he yearned over her so and it was 
so delightful she arose at dawn and began silently to dress thinking that she might 
take a walk leaving a note for eugene as to where to come and find 
her if he could she had one appointment for the day later she would have 
to go home but things would come out all right since eugene had compelled angela 
to relinquish her determination to inform her mother all must be well they would meet 
she and eugene she would leave her home and be his and they would go 
anywhere anywhere eugene desired only she would prefer to persuade her mother to see things 
from her point of view and later countenance some understanding between them here because of 
angela's and eugene's position here she preferred this because of her youth and her poetic 
erratic conception of life she assumed that she could overcome her mother and that she 
and eugene could live together somewhere in peace her friends might either be unaware of 
the situation or they could be told some of them and they might countenance it 
because it was so beautiful and natural eugene heard her stirring after a time and 
rose and went to her room and knocked when she opened the door almost fully 
dressed a thrill of pain passed over his heart for he thought that she had 
been intending to slip away without seeing him any moreso little they really knew each 
other but as she stood there a little cool or still or sober from much 
thought and the peculiar nature of her position she seemed more beautiful than ever you're 
not going are you he asked as she looked up at him with inquiring eyes 
i thought i'd go for a walk without me i intended to see you if 
i could or leave a note for you to come to me i thought you 
would will you wait for me he asked feeling as though he must hold her 
close forever in order to live just a little bit i want to change my 
clothes he took her in his arms yes she said softly you won't go without 
me no why do you ask oh i love you so he replied and pushed 
her head back and looked yearningly into her eyes she took his tired face between 
her hands and studied his eyes she was so enrapt by him now in this 
first burst of affection that she could see nothing but him he seemed so beautiful 
so hungry it did not matter to her now that she was in the home 
of his wife or that his love was complicated with so much that was apparently 
evil she loved him she had thought all night about him not sleeping being so 
young it was hard for her to reason clearly as yet but somehow it seemed 
to her that he was very unhappily placed terribly illmated and that he needed her 
he was so fine so clean so capable if he did not want angela why 
should she want him she would not be suffering for anything save his company and 
why should she want to hold him she suzanne would not if she were in 
angela's place if there were a child would that make any real difference he did 
not love her don't worry about me she said reassuringly i love you don't you 
know i do i have to talk to you we have to talk how is 
mrs witla she was thinking about what mrs witla would do whether she would call 
up her mother whether her struggle to have eugene would begin at once oh she's 
about the same he said wearily we've had a long argument i've told her just 
what i propose to do but i'll tell you about that later he went away 
to change his clothes and then stepped into angela's room i'm going to walk with 
suzanne he said dominantly when he was ready all right said angela who was so 
tired she could have fainted will you be back for dinner i don't know he 
replied what difference does it make only this: that the maid and cook need not 
stay unless you are coming i want nothing when will the nurse be here at 
seven well you can prepare dinner if you wish he said i will try and 
be back by four he walked toward the studio where suzanne was and found her 
waiting whitefaced slightly holloweyed but strong and confident now as so often before he noticed 
that spirit of selfsufficiency and reliance about her young body which had impressed him so 
forcibly and delightfully in the past she was a wonderful girl this suzanne full of 
grit and ability although raised under what might have been deemed enervating circumstances her statement 
made under pressure the night before that she must go to a hotel and not 
go home until she could straighten out her affairs had impressed him greatly why had 
she thought of going out in the world to work for herself unless there were 
something really fine about her she was heir to a fortune under her father's will 
he had heard her mother say once this morning her glance was so assured he 
did not use the phone to call a car but strolled out into the drive 
with her walking along the stone wall which commanded the river northward toward grant's tomb 
it occurred to him that they might go to claremont inn for breakfast and afterwards 
take a car somewherehe did not know quite where suzanne might be recognized so might 
he what shall we do sweet he asked as the cool morning air brushed their 
faces it was a glorious day i don't care replied suzanne i promised to be 
at the almerdings some time today but i didn't say when they won't think anything 
of it if i don't get there till after dinner will mrs witla call up 
mama i don't think so in fact i'm sure she won't he was thinking of 
his last conversation with angela when she said she would do nothing is your mother 
likely to call you up i think not mama doesn't usually bother when she knows 
where i am going if she does they'll simply say i haven't come yet will 
mrs witla tell her if she calls up there i think not he said no 
i'm sure she won't angela wants time to think she isn't going to do anything 
she told me that this morning she's going to wait until she sees what i 
am going to do it all depends now on how we play our cards he 
strolled on looking at the river and holding suzanne's hand it was only a quarter 
to seven and the drive was comparatively empty if she tells mama it will make 
things very bad said suzanne thoughtfully do you really think she won't i'm sure she 
won't i'm positive she doesn't want to do anything yet it's too dangerous i think 
she thinks that maybe i will come round oh what a life i've led it 
seems like a dream now that i have your love you are so different so 
generous your attitude is so unselfish to have been ruled all these years in every 
little thing this last trick of hers he shook his head woefully suzanne looked at 
his weary face her own as fresh as the morning oh if i might only 
have had you to begin with he added listen eugene said suzanne you know i 
feel sorry for mrs witla we shouldn't have done what we did last night but 
you made me you know you will never listen to me until it's too late 
you're so headstrong i don't want you to leave mrs witla unless you want to 
you needn't for me i don't want to marry you not now anyhow i'd rather 
just give myself to you if you want me to i want time though to 
think and plan if mama should hear today there would be a terrible time if 
we have time to think we may bring her round i don't care anything about 
what mrs witla told you last night i don't want you to leave her if 
we could just arrange some way it's mama you know she swung his hand softly 
in hers pressing his fingers she was deep in thought for her mother presented a 
real problem you know she went on mama isn't narrow she doesn't believe much in 
marriage unless it's ideal mrs witla's condition wouldn't make so much difference if only the 
child were here i've been thinking about that mama might sanction some arrangement if she 
thought it would make me happy and there was no scandal but i'll have to 
have time to talk to her it can't be done right away eugene listened to 
this with considerable surprise as he did to everything suzanne volunteered she seemed to have 
been thinking about these questions a long time she was not free with her opinions 
she hesitated and halted between words and in her cogitations but when they were out 
this was what they came to he wondered how sound they were suzanne he said 
you take my breath away how you think do you know what you're talking about 
do you know your mother at all well mama oh yes i think i understand 
mama you know she's very peculiar mama is literary and romantic she talks a great 
deal about liberty but i don't take in everything she says i think mama is 
different from most womenshe's exceptional she likes me not so much as a daughter as 
a person she's anxious about me you know i think i'm stronger than mama i 
think i could dominate her if i tried she leans on me now a lot 
and she can't make me do anything unless i want to i can make her 
come to my way of thinking i believe i have lots of times that's what 
makes me think i might now if i have time it will take time to 
get her to do what i want how much time asked eugene thoughtfully oh i 
don't know three months six months i can't tell i would like to try though 
and if you can't then what why thenwhy then i'll defy her that's all i'm 
not sure you know but i think i can and if you can't but i 
can i'm sure i can she tossed her head gaily and come to me and 
come to you they were near one hundredth street under the trees there was a 
lone man some distance away walking from them eugene caught suzanne in his arms and 
implanted a kiss upon her mouth oh you divinity he exclaimed helen circe no she 
replied with smiling eyes no not here wait till we get a car shall we 
go to claremont i'm not hungry then we might as well call a car and 
ride they hunted a garage and sped northward the wonderful wind of the morning cooling 
and refreshing their fevered senses both he and suzanne were naturally depressed at moments at 
other moments preternaturally gay for he was varying between joy and fear and she was 
buoying him up her attitude was calmer surer braver than his she was like a 
strong mother to him you know he said i don't know what to think at 
times i haven't any particular charge against mrs witla except that i don't love her 
i have been so unhappy what do you think of cases of this kind suzanne 
you heard what she said about me yes i heard it all comes from that 
i don't love her i never have really from the beginning what do you think 
where there is no love it is true part of what she said i have 
been in love with other women but it has always been because i have been 
longing for some sort of temperament that was congenial to me i have suzanne too 
since i have been married i can't say that i was really in love with 
carlotta wilson but i did like her she was very much like myself the other 
was a girl somewhat like you not so wise that was years ago oh i 
could tell you why i love youth i love beauty i want someone who is 
my companion mentally you are that suzanne and yet see what a hell it is 
creating do you think it is so bad where i am so very unhappy tell 
me what do you think why why said suzanne i don't think anyone ought to 
stick by a bad bargain eugene just what do you mean by that suzanne well 
you say you don't love her you're not happy with her i shouldn't think it 
would be good for her or you to have you stay with her she can 
live i wouldn't want you to stay with me if you didn't love me i 
wouldn't want you at all if you didn't i wouldn't want to stay with you 
if i didn't love you and i wouldn't i think marriage ought to be a 
happy bargain and if it isn't you oughtn't to try to stay together just because 
you thought you could stay together once what if there were children well that might 
be different even then one or the other could take them wouldn't you think the 
children needn't be made very unhappy in such a case eugene looked at suzanne's lovely 
face it seemed so strange to hear her reasoning so solemnlythis girl but you heard 
what she said about me suzanne and about her condition i know she said i've 
thought about it i don't see that it makes so very much difference you can 
take care of her you love me just as much yes even if all she 
says is true yes why suzanne well all her charges concerned years gone by and 
that isn't now and i know you love me now i don't care about the 
past you know eugene i don't care anything about the future either i want you 
to love me only so long as you want to love me when you are 
tired of me i want you to leave me i wouldn't want you to live 
with me if you didn't love me i wouldn't want to live with you if 
i didn't love you eugene looked into her face astonished pleased invigorated and heartened by 
this philosophy it was so like suzanne he thought she seemed to have reached definite 
and effective conclusions so early her young mind seemed a solvent for all life's difficulties 
oh you wonderful girl he said you know you are wiser than i am stronger 
i draw to you suzanne like a cold man to a fire you are so 
kindly so temperate so understanding they rode on toward tarrytown and scarborough and on the 
way eugene told suzanne some of his plans he was willing not to leave angela 
if that was agreeable to her he was willing to maintain this outward show if 
that was satisfactory the only point was could he stay and have her too he 
did not understand quite how she could want to share him with anybody but he 
could not fathom her from any point of view and he was fascinated she seemed 
the dearest the subtlest the strangest and most lovable girl he tried to find out 
by what process she proposed to overcome the objections of her mother but suzanne seemed 
to have no plans save that of her ability to gradually get the upper hand 
mentally and dominate her you know she said at one point i have money coming 
to me papa set aside two hundred thousand dollars for each of us children when 
we should come of age and i am of age now it is to be 
held in trust but i shall have twelve thousand or maybe more from that we 
can use that i am of age now and i have never said anything about 
it mama has managed all these things here was another thought which heartened eugene with 
suzanne he would have this additional income which might be used whatever else might betide 
if only angela could be made to accept his conditions and suzanne could win in 
her contest with her mother all would be well his position need not be jeopardized 
mrs dale need hear nothing of it at present he and suzanne could go on 
associating in this way until an understanding had been reached it was all like a 
delightful courtship which was to bloom into a still more delightful marriage the day passed 
in assurances of affection suzanne told eugene of a book she had read in french 
the blue bird the allegory touched eugene to the quickits quest for happiness and he 
named suzanne then and there the blue bird she made him stop the car and 
go back to get her an exquisite lavenderhued blossom growing wild on a tall stalk 
which she saw in a field as they sped by eugene objected genially because it 
was beyond a wire fence and set among thorns but she said yes now you 
must you know you must obey me now i am going to begin to train 
you now you've been spoiled you're a bad boy mama says that i am going 
to reform you a sweet time you'll have flower face i'm a bad lot have 
you noticed that a little and you still like me i don't mind i think 
i can change you by loving you eugene went gladly he plucked the magnificent bloom 
and handed it to her as a sceptre he said it looks like you you 
know he added it's regal suzanne accepted the compliment without thought of its flattering import 
she loved eugene and words had scarcely any meaning to her she was as happy 
as a child and as wise in many things as a woman twice her years 
she was as foolish as eugene over the beauty of nature dwelling in an ecstasy 
upon morning and evening skies the feel of winds and the sigh of leaves the 
beauties of nature at every turn caught her eye and she spoke to him of 
things she felt in such a simple way that he was entranced once when they 
had left the car and were walking about the grounds of an inn she found 
that one of her silk stockings had worn through at the heel she lifted up 
her foot and looked at it meditatively now if i had some ink i could 
fix that up so quickly she said laughing what would you do he asked i 
would black it she replied referring to her pink heel or you could paint it 
he laughed and she giggled it was these little idle simplicities which amused and fascinated 
him suzanne he said dramatically at this time you are taking me back into fairyland 
i want to make you happy she said as happy as i am if i 
could be if i only could be wait she said be cheerful don't worry everything 
will come out all right i know it will things always come right for me 
i want you and you will come to me you will have me just as 
i will have you oh it is all so beautiful she squeezed his hand in 
an ecstasy of delight and then gave him her lips what if someone should see 
he asked i don't care i don't care she cried i love you chapter xii 
after dining joyously these two returned to the city suzanne as she neared new york 
proper was nervous as to what angela might have done for she wanted in case 
angela told her mother to be present in order to defend herself she had reached 
a rather logical conclusion for her and that was in case her mother objected too 
vigorously to elope with eugene she wanted to see just how her mother would take 
the intelligence in order that she might see clearly what to do previously she had 
the feeling that she could persuade her mother not to interfere even in the face 
of all that had been revealed nevertheless she was nervous and her fears were bred 
to a certain extent by eugene's attitude in spite of all his bravado he really 
did not feel at all secure he was not afraid of what he might lose 
materially so much as he was of losing suzanne the thought of the coming child 
had not affected them at all as yet he could see clearly that conditions might 
come about whereby he could not have her but they were not in evidence as 
yet besides angela might be lying still at odd moments his conscience troubled him for 
in the midst of his intense satisfaction his keenest thrills of joy he could see 
angela lying in bed the thought of her wretched future before her the thought of 
the coming life troubling her or he could hear the echo of some of the 
pleas she had made it was useless to attempt to shut them out this was 
a terrible ordeal he was undergoing a ruthless thing he was doing all the laws 
of life and public sentiment were against him if the world knew it would accuse 
him bitterly he could not forget that he despaired at moments of ever being able 
to solve the tangle in which he had involved himself and yet he was determined 
to go on he proposed accompanying suzanne to her friends the almerdings but she changed 
her mind and decided to go home i want to see whether mama has heard 
anything she insisted eugene had to escort her to staten island and then order the 
chauffeur to put on speed so as to reach riverside by four he was somewhat 
remorseful but he argued that his lovelife was so long over in so far as 
angela was concerned that it could not really make so very much difference since suzanne 
wanted to wait a little time and proceed slowly it was not going to be 
as bad for angela as he had anticipated he was going to give her a 
choice of going her way and leaving him entirely either now or after the child 
was born giving her the half of his property stocks ready money and anything else 
that might be divisible and all the furniture or staying and tacitly ignoring the whole 
thing she would know what he was going to do to maintain a separate ménage 
or secret rendezvous for suzanne he proposed since suzanne was so generous not to debate 
this point but to insist he must have her and angela must yield choosing only 
her conditions when he came to the house a great change had come over angela 
in the morning when he left she was hard and bitter in her mood this 
afternoon she was albeit extremely sad more soft and melting than he had ever seen 
her her hard spirit was temporarily broken but in addition she had tried to resign 
herself to the inevitable and to look upon it as the will of god perhaps 
she had been as eugene had often accused her of being hard and cold perhaps 
she had held him in too tight leading strings she had meant it for the 
best she had tried to pray for light and guidance and after a while something 
softly sad like a benediction settled upon her she must not fight any more she 
thought she must yield god would guide her her smile kindly and wan when eugene 
entered the room took him unawares her explanation of her mood her prayers her willingness 
to give him up if need be even in the face of what was coming 
to her moved him more than anything that had ever passed between them he sat 
opposite her at dinner looking at her thin hands and face and her sad eyes 
trying to be cheerful and considerate and then going back into her room and hearing 
her say she would do whatever he deemed best burst into tears he cried from 
an excess of involuntary and uncontrolled emotion he hardly knew why he cried but the 
sadness of everythinglife the tangle of human emotions the proximity of death to all old 
age suzanne angela alltouched him and he shook as though he would rend his sides 
angela in turn was astonished and grieved for him she could scarcely believe her eyes 
was he repenting come to me eugene she pleaded oh i'm so sorry are you 
as much in love as that oh dear dear if i could only do something 
don't cry like that eugene if it means so much to you i will give 
you up it tears my heart to hear you oh dear please don't cry he 
laid his head on his knees and shook then seeing her getting up came over 
to the bed to prevent her no no he said it will pass i can't 
help it i'm sorry for you i'm sorry for myself i'm sorry for life god 
will punish me for this i can't help it but you are a good woman 
he laid his head down beside her and sobbed great aching sobs after a time 
he recovered himself only to find that he had given angela courage anew she would 
think now that his love might be recovered since he had seemed so sympathetic that 
suzanne might be displaced he knew that could not be and so he was sorry 
that he had cried they went on from that to discussion to argument to illfeeling 
to sympathetic agreement again by degrees only to fall out anew angela could not resign 
herself to the thought of giving him up eugene could not see that he was 
called upon to do anything save divide their joint possessions he was most anxious to 
have nothing to do with angela anymore in any way he might live in the 
same house but that would be all he was going to have suzanne he was 
going to live for her only he threatened angela with dire consequences if she tried 
to interfere in any way if she communicated with mrs dale or said anything to 
suzanne or attempted to injure him commercially he would leave her here is the situation 
he would insist you can maintain it as i say or break it if you 
break it you lose me and everything that i represent if you maintain it i 
will stay here i think i will i am perfectly willing to keep up appearances 
but i want my freedom angela thought and thought of this she thought once of 
sending for mrs dale and communicating with her secretly urging her to get suzanne out 
of the way without forewarning either the girl or eugene but she did not do 
this it was the one thing she should have done and a thing mrs dale 
would have agreed to but fear and confusion deterred her the next thing was to 
write or talk to suzanne and because she mistrusted her mood in suzanne's presence she 
decided to write she lay in bed on monday when eugene was away at the 
office and composed a long letter in which she practically gave the history of eugene's 
life reiterating her own condition and stating what she thought eugene ought to do how 
can you think suzanne she asked in one place that he will be true to 
you when he can ignore me in this condition he has not been true to 
anyone else are you going to throw your life away your station is assured now 
what can he add to you that you have not already if you take him 
it is sure to become known you are the one who will be injured not 
he men recover from these things particularly from an infatuation of this character and the 
world thinks nothing of it but the world will not forgive you you will be 
'a bad woman' after this irretrievably so if a child is born you think you 
love him do you really love him this much read this and stop and think 
think of his character i am used to him i made my mistakes in the 
beginning and it is too late for me to change the world can give me 
nothing i may have sorrow and disgust but at least i shall not be an 
outcast and our friends and the world will not be scandalized but youyou have everything 
before you some man will come to you whom you will love and who will 
not ask and willingly make a sacrifice of you oh i beg you to think 
you do not need him after all sorry as i am to confess it i 
do it is as i tell you can you really afford to ignore this appeal 
suzanne read this and was greatly shocked angela painted him in a wretched light as 
fickle deceitful dishonest in his relations with women she debated this matter in her own 
room for it could not help but give her pause after a time eugene's face 
came back to her however his beautiful mind the atmosphere of delight and perfection that 
seemed to envelop all that surrounded him it was as though eugene were a mirage 
of beauty so soft so sweet so delightful oh to be with him to hear 
his beautiful voice to feel his intense caresses what could life offer her equal to 
that and besides he needed her she decided to talk it out with him show 
him the letter and then decide eugene came in a day or two having phoned 
monday and tuesday mornings he made a rendezvous of the ice house and then appeared 
as eager and smiling as ever since returning to the office and seeing no immediate 
sign of a destructive attitude on angela's part he had recovered his courage he was 
hopeful of a perfect dénouement to all thisof a studio and his lovely suzanne when 
they were seated in the auto she immediately produced angela's letter and handed it to 
him without comment eugene read it quietly he was greatly shocked at what he read 
for he thought that angela was more kindly disposed toward him still he knew it 
to be true all of it though he was not sure that suzanne would suffer 
from his attentions the fates might be kind they might be happy together anyhow he 
wanted her now well he said giving it back what of it do you believe 
all she says it may be so but somehow when i am with you i 
don't seem to care when i am away from you it's different i'm not so 
sure you can't tell whether i am as good as you think i am i 
don't know what to think i suppose all she says about you is true i'm 
not sure when you're away it's different when you are here i feel as though 
everything must come out right i love you so oh i know it will she 
threw her arms around him then the letter doesn't really make any difference no she 
looked at him with big round eyes and it was the old story bliss in 
affection without thought they rode miles stopped at an inn for something to eatmrs dale 
was away for the daylooked at the sea where the return road skirted it and 
kissed and kissed each other suzanne grew so ecstatic that she could see exactly how 
it was all coming out now you leave it to me she said i will 
sound mama if she is at all logical i think i can convince her i 
would so much rather do it that way i hate deception i would rather just 
tell her and then if i have to defy her i don't think i shall 
have to though she can't do anything i don't know about that said eugene cautiously 
he had come to have great respect for suzanne's courage and he was rather relying 
on mrs dale's regard for him to stay her from any desperate course but he 
did not see how their end was to be achieved he was for entering on 
an illicit relationship after a time without saying anything at all he was in no 
hurry for his feeling for suzanne was not purely physical though he wanted her because 
of her strange reading and philosophy she was defying the world she insisted that she 
did not see how it would hurt her but my dear you don't know life 
said eugene it will hurt you it will grind you to pieces in all places 
outside of new york this is the metropolis it is a world city things are 
not quite the same here but you will have to pretend anyhow it is so 
much easier can you protect me she asked significantly referring to the condition angela pleaded 
i wouldn't wanti couldn't you know not yet not yet i understand he said yes 
i can absolutely well i want to think about it she said again i prefer 
so much to be honest about it i would so much rather just tell mama 
and then go and do it it would be so much nicer my life is 
my own to do with as i please it doesn't concern anybody not even mama 
you know if i want to waste it i may only i don't think that 
i am doing so i want to live as i choose i don't want to 
get married yet eugene listened to her with the feeling that this was the most 
curious experience of his life he had never heard never seen never experienced anything like 
it the case of christina channing was different she had her art to consider suzanne 
had nothing of the sort she had a lovely home a social future money the 
chance of a happy stable normal life this was love surely and yet he was 
quite at sea still so many favorable things had happened consciously favorable that he was 
ready to believe that all this was intended for his benefit by a kind governing 
providence angela had practically given in already why not suzanne's mother angela would not tell 
her anything mrs dale was not any stronger than angela apparently suzanne might be able 
to control her as she said if she was so determined to try could he 
really stop her she was headstrong in a way and wilful but developing rapidly and 
reasoning tremendously perhaps she could do this thing who could tell they came flying back 
along lovely lanes where the trees almost swept their faces past green stretches of marsh 
where the wind stirred in ripples the tall green cat grass past pretty farm yards 
with children and ducks in the foreground beautiful mansions playing children sauntering laborers all the 
while they were reassuring each other vowing perfect affection holding each other close suzanne as 
angela had loved to take eugene's face between her hands and look into his eyes 
look at me she said once when he had dolefully commented upon the possibility of 
change look straight into my eyes what do you see courage and determination he said 
what else love do you think i will change no surely no well look at 
me straight eugene i won't i won't do you hear i'm yours until you don't 
want me anymore now will you be happy yes he said and when we get 
our studio she went on when we get our studio he said we'll furnish it 
perfectly and entertain a little after a while maybe you'll be my lovely suzanne my 
flower face my myrtle blossom helen circe dianeme i'll be your weekend bride she laughed 
your odd or even girl whichever way the days fall if it only comes true 
he exclaimed when they parted if it only does wait and see she said now 
you wait and see the days passed and suzanne began what she called her campaign 
her first move was to begin to talk about the marriage question at the dinner 
table or whenever she and her mother were alone and to sound her on this 
important question putting her pronouncements on record mrs dale was one of those empirical thinkers 
who love to philosophize generally but who make no specific application of anything to their 
own affairs on this marriage question she held most liberal and philosophic views for all 
outside her own immediate family it was her idea outside her own family of course 
that if a girl having reached maturity and what she considered a sound intellectual majority 
and who was not by then satisfied with the condition which matrimony offered if she 
loved no man desperately enough to want to marry him and could arrange some way 
whereby she could satisfy her craving for love without jeopardizing her reputation that was her 
lookout so far as mrs dale was concerned she had no particular objection she knew 
women in society who having made unfortunate marriages or marriages of convenience sustained some such 
relationship to men whom they admired there was a subtle under the surface understanding outside 
the society circles of the most rigid morality in regard to this and there was 
the fast set of which she was at times a welcome member which laughed at 
the severe conventions of the older school one must be carefulvery one must not be 
caught but otherwise well every person's life was a law unto him or herself suzanne 
never figured in any of these theories for suzanne was a beautiful girl capable of 
an exalted alliance and her daughter she did not care to marry her off to 
any wretched possessor of great wealth or title solely for wealth's or title's sake but 
she was hoping that some eligible young man of excellent social standing or wealth or 
real personal ability such for instance as eugene possessed would come along and marry suzanne 
there would be a grand wedding at a church of some prominencest bartholomew's very likely 
a splendid wedding dinner oceans of presents a beautiful honeymoon she used to look at 
suzanne and think what a delightful mother she would make she was so young robust 
vigorous able and in a quiet way passionate she could tell when she danced how 
eagerly she took life the young man would come it would not be long these 
lovely springtimes would do their work one of these days as it was there were 
a score of men already who would have given an eye to attract suzanne's attention 
but suzanne would none of them she seemed shy coy elusive but above all shy 
her mother had no idea of the iron will all this concealed any more than 
she had of the hard anarchic unsocial thoughts that were surging in her daughter's brain 
do you think a girl ought to marry at all mama suzanne asked her one 
evening when they were alone together if she doesn't regard marriage as a condition she 
could endure all her days noo replied her mother what makes you ask well you 
see so much trouble among married people that we know they're not very happy together 
wouldn't it be better if a person just stayed single and if they found someone 
that they could really love well they needn't necessarily marry to be happy need they 
what have you been reading lately suzanne asked her mother looking up with a touch 
of surprise in her eyes nothing lately what makes you ask said suzanne wisely noting 
the change in her mother's voice with whom have you been talking why what difference 
does that make mama i've heard you express precisely the same views quite so i 
may have but don't you think you're rather young to be thinking of things like 
that i don't say all that i think when i'm arguing things philosophically there are 
conditions which govern everything if it were impossible for a girl to marry well or 
if looks or lack of money interferedthere are plenty of reasonsa thing like that might 
possibly be excusable but why should you be thinking of that why it doesn't necessarily 
follow mama that because i am good looking or have a little money or am 
socially eligible that i should want to get married i may not want to get 
married at all i see just as well as you do how things are with 
most people why shouldn't i do i have to keep away from every man then 
why suzanne i never heard you argue like this before you must have been talking 
with someone or reading some outré book of late i wish you wouldn't you are 
too young and too good looking to entertain any such ideas why you can have 
nearly any young man you wish surely you can find someone with whom you can 
live happily or with whom you would be willing to try it's time enough to 
think about the other things when you've tried and failed at least you can give 
yourself ample time to learn something about life before you begin to talk such nonsense 
you're too young why it's ridiculous mama said suzanne with the least touch of temper 
i wish you wouldn't talk to me like that i'm not a child any more 
i'm a woman i think like a womannot like a girl you forget that i 
have a mind of my own and some thoughts i may not want to get 
married i don't think i do certainly not to any of the silly creatures that 
are running after me now why shouldn't i take some man in an independent way 
if i wish other women have before me even if they hadn't it would be 
no reason why i shouldn't my life is my own suzanne dale exclaimed her mother 
rising a thrill of terror passing along her heartstrings what are you talking about are 
you basing these ideas on anything i have said in the past then certainly my 
chickens are coming home to roost early you are in no position to consider whether 
you want to get married or not you have seen practically nothing of men why 
should you reach any such conclusions now for goodness' sake suzanne don't begin so early 
to meditate on these terrible things give yourself a few years in which to see 
the world i don't ask you to marry but you may meet some man whom 
you could love very much and who would love you if you were to go 
and throw yourself away under some such silly theory as you entertain now without stopping 
to see or waiting for life to show you what it has in store what 
will you have to offer him suzanne suzannesuzanne was turning impatiently to a windowyou frighten 
me there isn't there couldn't be oh suzanne i beg of you be careful what 
you think what you say what you do i can't know all your thoughts no 
mother can but oh if you will stop and think and wait a while she 
looked at suzanne who walked to a mirror and began to fix a bow in 
her hair mama she said calmly really you amuse me when you are out with 
people at dinner you talk one way and when you are here with me you 
talk another i haven't done anything desperate yet i don't know what i may want 
to do i'm not a child any more mama please remember that i'm a woman 
grown and i certainly can lay out my life for myself i'm sure i don't 
want to do what you are doingtalk one thing and do another mrs dale recoiled 
intensely from this stab suzanne had suddenly developed in the line of her argument a 
note of determination frank force and serenity of logic which appalled her where had the 
girl got all this with whom had she been associating she went over in her 
mind the girls and men she had met and known who were her intimate companionsvera 
almerding lizette woodworth cora teneycka half dozen girls who were smart and clever and socially 
experienced were they talking such things among themselves was there some man or men unduly 
close to them there was one remedy for all this it must be acted on 
quickly if suzanne were going to fall in with and imbibe any such ideas as 
these traveltwo or three years of incessant travel with her which would cover this dangerous 
period in which girls were so susceptible to undue influence was the necessary thing oh 
her own miserable tongue her silly ideas no doubt all she said was true generally 
it was so but suzanne her suzanne never she would take her away while she 
had time to grow older and wiser through experience never would she be permitted to 
stay here where girls and men were talking and advocating any such things she would 
scan suzanne's literature more closely from now on she would viser her friendships what a 
pity that so lovely a girl must be corrupted by such wretched unsocial anarchistic notions 
why what would become of her girl where would she be dear heaven she looked 
down in the social abyss yawning at her feet and recoiled with horror never never 
never suzanne should be saved from herself from all such ideas now and at once 
and she began to think how she could introduce the idea of travel easily and 
nicely she must lure suzanne to go without alarming herwithout making her think that she 
was bringing pressure to bear but from now on there must be a new order 
established she must talk differently she must act differently suzanne and all her children must 
be protected against themselves and others also that was the lesson which this conversation taught 
her chapter xiii eugene and angela had been quarreling between themselves most bitterly at other 
times angela was attempting to appeal to his sense of justice and fair play if 
not his oldtime affection in the subtlest of ways she was completely thrown out of 
her old methods of calculation and having lost those had really no traditions on which 
to proceed eugene had always heretofore apparently feared her wrath now he cared nothing for 
that he had been subject in times past to a certain extent to those alluring 
blandishments which the married will understand well enough but these were as ashes her charms 
meant nothing to him she had hoped that the thought of a coming child would 
move him but no it was apparently without avail suzanne seemed a monster to her 
now since she did not desert him and eugene a raving maniac almost and yet 
she could see how human and natural it all was he was hypnotized possessed he 
had one thought suzanne suzanne and he would fight her at every turn for that 
he told her so he told her of her letter to suzanne and the fact 
that he had read and destroyed it it did not help her cause at all 
she knew that she had decried him he stood his ground solidly awaiting the will 
of suzanne and he saw suzanne frequently telling her that he had won completely and 
that the fulfilment of their desires now depended upon her as has been said suzanne 
was not without passion the longer she associated with eugene the more eager she became 
for that joyous fulfilment which his words his looks his emotions indicated in her foolish 
girlish way she had built up a fancy which was capable of realization only by 
the most ruthless and desperate conduct her theory of telling her mother and overcoming her 
by argument or defiance was really vain for it could not be settled so easily 
or so quickly because of her mother's appeal to her in this first conversation she 
fancied she had won a substantial victory her mother was subject to her control and 
could not defeat her in argument by the latter token she felt she was certain 
to win besides she was counting heavily on her mother's regard for eugene and her 
deep affection for herself hitherto her mother had really refused her nothing the fact that 
eugene did not take her outright at this timepostponing until a more imperative occasion an 
adjustment of the difficulties which must necessarily flow from their attempted union without marriagewas due 
to the fact that he was not as desperate or as courageous as he appeared 
to be he wanted her but he was a little afraid of suzanne herself she 
was doubtful anxious to wait anxious to plan things her own way he was not 
truly ruthless ever but good natured and easy going he was no subtle schemer and 
planner but rather an easy natured soul who drifted here and there with all the 
tides and favorable or unfavorable winds of circumstance he might have been ruthless if he 
had been eager enough for any one particular thing on this earth money fame affection 
but at bottom he really did not care as much as he thought he did 
anything was really worth fighting for if you had to have it but it was 
not worth fighting for to the bitter end if you could possibly get along without 
it besides there was nothing really one could not do without if one were obliged 
he might long intensely but he could survive he was more absorbed in this desire 
than in anything else in his history but he was not willing to be hard 
and grasping on the other hand suzanne was willing to be taken but needed to 
be pressed or compelled she imagined in a vague way that she wanted to wait 
and adjust things in her own way but she was merely dreaming procrastinating because he 
was procrastinating if he had but compelled her at once she would have been happy 
but he was sadly in need of that desperate energy that acts first and thinks 
afterward like hamlet he was too fond of cogitating too anxious to seek the less 
desperate way and in doing this was jeopardizing that ideal bliss for which he was 
willing to toss away all the material advantages which he had thus far gained when 
mrs dale quite casually within a few days began to suggest that they leave new 
york for the fall and winter she suzanne and kinroy and visit first england then 
southern france and then egypt suzanne immediately detected something intentional about it or at best 
a very malicious plan on the part of fate to destroy her happiness she had 
been conjecturing how temporarily she could avoid distant and long drawn out engagements which her 
mother not infrequently accepted for herself and suzanne outside new york but she had not 
formulated a plan mrs dale was very popular and much liked this easy suggestion made 
with considerable assurance by her mother and as though it would be just the thing 
frightened and then irritated suzanne why should her mother think of it just at this 
time i don't want to go to europe she said warily we were over there 
only three years ago i'd rather stay over here this winter and see what's going 
on in new york but this trip will be so delightful suzanne her mother insisted 
the camerons are to be at callendar in scotland for the fall they have taken 
a cottage there i had a note from louise tuesday i thought we might run 
up there and see them and then go to the isle of wight i don't 
care to go mama replied suzanne determinedly we're settled here comfortably why do you always 
want to be running off somewhere why i'm not runninghow you talk suzanne i never 
heard you object very much to going anywhere before i should think egypt and the 
riviera would interest you very much you haven't been to either of these places i 
know they're delightful but i don't care to go this fall i'd rather stay here 
why should you suddenly decide that you want to go away for a year i 
haven't suddenly decided insisted her mother i've been thinking of it for some time as 
you know haven't i said that we would spend a winter in europe soon the 
last time i mentioned it you were very keen for it oh i know mama 
but that was nearly a year ago i don't want to go now i would 
rather stay here why would you more of your friends go away than remain i 
think a particularly large number of them are going this winter ha ha ho ho 
laughed suzanne a particularly large number how you exaggerate mama when you want anything you 
always amuse me it's a particularly large number now just because you want to go 
and she laughed again suzanne's defiance irritated her mother why should she suddenly take this 
notion to stay here it must be this group of girls she was in with 
and yet suzanne appeared to have so few intimate girl friends the almerdings were not 
going to stay in town all the winter they were here now because of a 
fire at their country place but it would only be for a little while neither 
were the teneycks it couldn't be that suzanne was interested in some man the only 
person she cared much about was eugene witla and he was married and only friendly 
in a brotherly guardianlike way now suzanne she said determinedly i'm not going to have 
you talk nonsense this trip will be a delightful thing for you once you have 
started it's useless for you to let a silly notion like not wanting to go 
stand in your way you are just at the time when you ought to travel 
now you had better begin to prepare yourself for we're going oh no i'm not 
mama said suzanne why you talk as though i were a very little girl i 
don't want to go this fall and i'm not going you may go if you 
want to but i'm not going why suzanne dale exclaimed her mother whatever has come 
over you of course you'll go where would you stay if i went do you 
think i would walk off and leave you have i ever before you did when 
i was at boarding school interrupted suzanne that was a different matter then you were 
under proper supervision mrs hill was answerable to me for your care here you would 
be alone what do you think i would be doing there you go mama talking 
as though i was a little girl again will you please remember that i am 
nearly nineteen i know how to look after myself besides there are plenty of people 
with whom i might stay if i chose suzanne dale you talk like one possessed 
i'll listen to nothing of the sort you are my daughter and as such subject 
to my guardianship of what are you thinking what have you been reading there's some 
silly thing at the bottom of all this i'll not go away and leave you 
and you will come with me i should think that after all these years of 
devotion on my part you would take my feelings into consideration how can you stand 
there and argue with me in this way arguing mama asked suzanne loftily i'm not 
arguing i'm just not going i have my reasons for not wanting to go and 
i'm not going that's all now you may go if you want to mrs dale 
looked into suzanne's eyes and saw for the first time a gleam of real defiance 
in them what had brought this about why was her daughter so setof a sudden 
so stubborn and hard fear anger astonishment mingled equally in her feelings what do you 
mean by reasons asked her mother what reasons have you a very good one said 
suzanne quietly twisting it to the singular well what is it then pray suzanne debated 
swiftly and yet a little vaguely in her own mind she had hoped for a 
longer process of philosophic discussion in which to entrap her mother into some moral and 
intellectual position from which she could not well recede and by reason of which she 
would have to grant her the license she desired from one remark and another dropped 
in this and the preceding conversation she realized that her mother had no logical arrangement 
in her mind whereby she included her in her philosophical calculations at all she might 
favor any and every theory and conclusion under the sun but it would mean nothing 
in connection with suzanne the only thing that remained therefore was to defy her or 
run away and suzanne did not want to do the latter she was of age 
she could adjust her own affairs she had money her mental point of view was 
as good and sound as her mother's as a matter of fact the latter's attitude 
in view of suzanne's recent experience and feelings seemed weak and futile what did her 
mother know of life any more than she they were both in the world and 
suzanne felt herself to be the strongerthe sounder of the two why not tell her 
now and defy her she would win she must she could dominate her mother and 
this was the time to do it because i want to stay near the man 
i love she finally volunteered quietly mrs dale's hand which had been elevated to a 
position of gesticulation before her dropped limp involuntarily to her side her mouth opened the 
least bit she stared in a surprised anguished semifoolish way the man you love suzanne 
she asked swept completely from her moorings and lost upon a boundless sea who is 
he mr witla mamaeugene i love him and he loves me don't stare mama mrs 
witla knows she is willing that we should have each other we love each other 
i am going to stay here where i can be near him he needs me 
eugene witla exclaimed her mother breathless a look of horror in her eyes cold fright 
in her tense hands you love eugene witla a married man he loves you are 
you talking to me eugene witla you love him why i can't believe this i'm 
not in my right mind suzanne dale don't stand there don't look at me like 
that are you telling me your mother tell me it isn't so tell me it 
isn't so before you drive me mad oh great heavens what am i coming to 
what have i done eugene witla of all men oh god oh god oh god 
why do you carry on so mama asked suzanne calmly she had expected some such 
scene as thisnot quite so intense so hysterical but something like it and was in 
a way prepared for it a selfish love was her animating governing impulsea love also 
that stilled self and put aside as nothing all the world and its rules suzanne 
really did not know what she was doing she was hypnotized by the sense of 
perfection in her lover the beauty of their love not practical facts but the beauty 
of the summer the feel of cool winds the glory of skies and sunlight and 
moonlight were in her mind eugene's arms about her his lips to hers meant more 
than all the world beside i love him of course i love him what is 
there so strange about that what is strange are you in your right mind oh 
my poor dear little girl my suzanne oh that villain that scoundrel to come into 
my house and make love to you my darling child how should you know how 
could i expect you to understand oh suzanne for my sake for the love of 
heaven hush never breathe it never say that terrible thing to me again oh dear 
oh dear oh dear that i should live to see this my child my suzanne 
my lovely beautiful suzanne i shall die unless i can stop this i shall die 
i shall die suzanne stared at her mother quite astonished at the violent emotion into 
which she had cast her her pretty eyes were open wide her eyebrows elevated her 
lips parted sweetly she was a picture of intense classic beauty chiseled peaceful selfpossessed her 
brow was as smooth as marble her lips as arched as though they had never 
known one emotion outside joy her look was of a quizzical slightly amused but not 
supercilious character which made her more striking than ever if possible why mama you think 
i am a child don't you all that i say to you is true i 
love eugene he loves me i am going to live with him as soon as 
it can be quietly arranged i wanted to tell you because i don't want to 
do anything secretly but i propose to do it i wish you wouldn't insist on 
looking on me as a baby mama i know what i am doing i have 
thought it all out this long time thought it all out pondered mrs dale going 
to live with him when it can be arranged is she talking of living with 
a man without a wedding ceremony being performed with a man already married is the 
child stark mad something has turned her brain surely something has this is not my 
suzannemy dear lovely entrancing suzanne to suzanne she exclaimed aloud: are you talking of living 
with this with this oh i don't dare to name him i'll die if i 
don't get this matter straightened out of living without a marriage ceremony and without his 
being divorced i can't believe that i am awake i can't i can't certainly i 
am replied suzanne it is all arranged between us mrs witla knows she has given 
her consent i expect you to give yours if you desire me to stay here 
mama give my consent as god is my witness am i alive is this my 
daughter talking to me am i in this room here with you i she stopped 
her mouth wide open if it weren't so horribly tragic i should laugh i will 
i will become hysterical my brain is whirling like a wheel now suzanne dale you 
are insane you are madly foolishly insane if you do not hush and cease this 
terrible palaver i will have you locked up i will have an inquiry made into 
your sanity this is the wildest most horrible most unimaginable thing ever proposed to a 
mother to think that i should have lived with you eighteen long years carried you 
in my arms nursed you at my breast and then have you stand here and 
tell me that you will go and live unsanctioned with a man who has a 
good true woman now living as his wife this is the most astounding thing i 
have ever heard of it is unbelievable you will not do it you will no 
more do it than you will fly i will kill him i will kill you 
i would rather see you dead at my feet this minute than to even think 
that you could have stood there and proposed such a thing to me it will 
never be it will never be i will give you poison first i will do 
anything everything but you shall never see this man again if he dares to cross 
this threshold i will kill him at sight i love you i think you are 
a wonderful girl but this thing shall never be and don't you dare to attempt 
to dissuade me i will kill you i tell you i would rather see you 
dead a thousand times to think to think to think oh that beast that villain 
that unconscionable cur to think that he should come into my house after all my 
courtesy to him and do this thing to me wait he has position he has 
distinction i will drive him out of new york i will ruin him i will 
make it impossible for him to show his face among decent people wait and see 
her face was white her hands clenched her teeth set she had a keen savage 
beauty much like that of a tigress when it shows its teeth her eyes were 
hard and cruel and flashing suzanne had never imagined her mother capable of such a 
burst of rage as this why mama she said calmly and quite unmoved you talk 
as though you ruled my life completely you would like to make me feel i 
suppose that i do not dare to do what i choose i do mama my 
life is my own not yours you cannot frighten me i have made up my 
mind what i am going to do in this matter and i am going to 
do it you cannot stop me you might as well not try if i don't 
do it now i will later i love eugene i am going to live with 
him if you won't let me i will go away but i propose to live 
with him and you might as well stop now trying to frighten me for you 
can't frighten you frighten you suzanne dale you haven't the faintest weakest conception of what 
you are talking about or of what i mean to do if a breath of 
thisthe faintest intimation of your intention were to get abroad you would be socially ostracized 
do you realize that you would not have a friend left in the worldthat all 
the people you now know and are friendly with would go across the street to 
avoid you if you didn't have independent means you couldn't even get a position in 
an ordinary shop going to live with him you are going to die first right 
here in my charge and in my arms i love you too much not to 
kill you i would a thousand times rather die with you myself you are not 
going to see that man any more not once and if he dares to show 
his face here i will kill him i have said it i mean it now 
you provoke me to action if you dare suzanne merely smiled how you talk mama 
you make me laugh mrs dale stared oh suzanne suzanne she suddenly exclaimed before it 
is too late before i learn to hate you before you break my heart come 
to my arms and tell me that you are sorrythat it is all overthat it 
is all a vile dark hateful dream oh my suzanne my suzanne no mama no 
don't come near don't touch me said suzanne drawing back you haven't any idea of 
what you are talking about of what i am or what i mean to do 
you don't understand me you never did mama you have always looked down on me 
in some superior way as though you knew a great deal and i very little 
it isn't that way at all it isn't true i know what i am about 
i know what i am doing i love mr witla and i am going to 
live with him mrs witla understands she knows how it is you will i don't 
care anything at all about what people think i don't care what any society friends 
do they are not making my life they are all just as narrow and selfish 
as they can be anyhow love is something different from that you don't understand me 
i love eugene and he is going to have me and i am going to 
have him if you want to try to wreck my life and his you may 
but it won't make any difference i will have him anyhow we might just as 
well quit talking about it now quit talking about it quit talking about it indeed 
i haven't even begun talking yet i am just trying to collect my wits that's 
all you are raging in insanity this thing will never be it will never be 
you are just a poor deluded slip of girl whom i have failed to watch 
sufficiently from now on i will do my duty by you if god spares me 
you need me oh how you need me poor little suzanne oh hush mama stop 
the hysteria interrupted suzanne i will call up mr colfax i will call up mr 
winfield i will have him discharged i will expose him in the newspapers the scoundrel 
the villain the thief oh that i should have lived to see this day that 
i should have lived to have seen this day that's right mama said suzanne wearily 
go on you are just talking you know and i know that you are you 
cannot change me talking cannot it is silly to rave like this i think why 
won't you be quiet we may talk but needn't scream mrs dale put her hands 
to her temples her brain seemed to be whirling never mind now she said never 
mind i must have time to think but this thing you are thinking will never 
be it never will be oh oh and she turned sobbing to the window suzanne 
merely stared what a peculiar thing emotions were in peopletheir emotions over morals here was 
her mother weeping and she was looking upon the thing her mother was crying about 
as the most essential and delightful and desirable thing certainly life was revealing itself to 
her rapidly these days did she really love eugene so much yes yes yes indeed 
a thousand times yes this was not a tearful emotion for her but a great 
consuming embracing joy chapter xiv for hours that night until one two and three o'clock 
in the morning from five six and seven on until noon and night of the 
next day and the next day after that and the fourth day and the fifth 
day the storm continued it was a terrible siege heart burning heart breaking brain racking 
mrs dale lost weight rapidly the color left her cheeks a haggard look settled in 
her eyes she was terrified nonplussed driven to extremities for means wherewith to overcome suzanne's 
opposition and suddenly but terribly developed will no one would have dreamed that this quiet 
sweetmannered introspective girl could be so positive convinced and unbending when in action she was 
as a fluid body that has become adamant she was a creature made of iron 
a girl with a heart of stone nothing moved herher mother's tears her threats of 
social ostracism of final destruction of physical and moral destruction for eugene and herself her 
threats of public exposure in the newspapers of incarceration in an asylum suzanne had watched 
her mother a long time and concluded that she loved to talk imposingly in an 
easy philosophic at times pompous way but that really there was very little in what 
she said she did not believe that her mother had true couragethat she would risk 
incarcerating her in an asylum or exposing eugene to her own disadvantage let alone poisoning 
or killing her her mother loved her she would rage terribly for a time this 
way then she would give in it was suzanne's plan to wear her down to 
stand her ground firmly until her mother wearied and broke under the strain then she 
would begin to say a few words for eugene and eventually by much arguing and 
blustering her mother would come round eugene would be admitted to the family councils again 
he and suzanne would argue it all out together in her mother's presence they would 
probably agree to disagree in a secret way but she would get eugene and he 
her oh the wonder of that joyous dénouement it was so near now and all 
for a little courageous fighting she would fight fight until her mother broke and thenoh 
eugene eugene mrs dale was not to be so easily overcome as suzanne imagined haggard 
and worn as she was she was far from yielding there was an actual physical 
conflict between them once when suzanne in the height of an argument decided that she 
would call up eugene on the phone and ask him to come down and help 
her settle the discussion mrs dale was determined that she should not the servants were 
in the house listening unable to catch at first the drift of the situation but 
knowing almost by intuition that there was a desperate discussion going on suzanne decided to 
go down to the library where the phone was mrs dale put her back to 
the door and attempted to deter her suzanne tried to open it by pulling her 
mother unloosed her hands desperately but it was very difficult suzanne was so strong for 
shame she said for shame to make your mother contest with you oh the degradationthe 
while she was struggling finally angry hysteric tears coursed involuntarily down her cheeks and suzanne 
was moved at last it was so obvious that this was real bitter heartburning on 
her mother's part her hair was shaken loose on one sideher sleeve torn oh my 
goodness my goodness mrs dale gasped at last throwing herself in a chair and sobbing 
bitterly i shall never lift my head again i shall never lift my head again 
suzanne looked at her somewhat sorrowfully i'm sorry mama she said but you have brought 
it all on yourself i needn't call him now he will call me and i 
will answer it all comes from your trying to rule me in your way you 
won't realize that i am a personality also quite as much as you are i 
have my life to live it is mine to do with as i please you 
are not going to prevent me in the long run you might just as well 
stop fighting with me now i don't want to quarrel with you i don't want 
to argue but i am a grown woman mama why don't you listen to reason 
why don't you let me show you how i feel about this two people loving 
each other have a right to be with each other it isn't anyone else's concern 
anyone else's concern anyone else's concern replied her mother viciously what nonsense what silly lovesick 
drivel if you had any idea of life of how the world is organized you 
would laugh at yourself ten years from now one year even you will begin to 
see what a terrible mistake you are trying to make you will scarcely believe that 
you could have done or said what you are doing and saying now anyone else's 
concern oh merciful heaven will nothing put even a suggestion of the wild foolish reckless 
character of the thing you are trying to do in your mind but i love 
him mama said suzanne love love you talk about love said her mother bitterly and 
hysterically what do you know about it do you think he can be loving you 
when he wants to come here and take you out of a good home and 
a virtuous social condition and wreck your life and bring you down into the mire 
your life and mine and that of your sisters and brother for ever and ever 
what does he know of love what do you think of adele and ninette and 
kinroy have you no regard for them where is your love for me and for 
them oh i have been so afraid that kinroy might hear something of this he 
would go and kill him i know he would i couldn't prevent it oh the 
shame the scandal the wreck it would involve us all in have you no conscience 
suzanne no heart suzanne stared before her calmly the thought of kinroy moved her a 
little he might kill eugeneshe couldn't tellhe was a courageous boy still there was no 
need for any killing or exposure or excitement of any kind if her mother would 
only behave herself what difference did it make to her or kinroy or anybody anywhere 
what she did why couldn't she if she wanted to the risk was on her 
head she was willing she couldn't see what harm it would do she expressed this 
thought to her mother once who answered in an impassioned plea for her to look 
at the facts how many evil women of the kind and character you would like 
to make of yourself do you know how many would you like to know how 
many do you suppose there are in good society look at this situation from mrs 
witla's point of view how would you like to be in her place how would 
you like to be in mine suppose you were mrs witla and mrs witla were 
the other woman what then i would let him go said suzanne yes yes yes 
you would let him go you might but how would you feel how would anyone 
feel can't you see the shame in all this the disgrace have you no comprehension 
at all no feeling oh how you talk mama how silly you talk you don't 
know the facts mrs witla doesn't love him any more she told me so she 
has written me so i had the letter and gave it back to eugene he 
doesn't care for her she knows it she knows he cares for me what difference 
does it make if she doesn't love him he's entitled to love somebody now i 
love him i want him he wants me why shouldn't we have each other in 
spite of all her threats mrs dale was not without subsidiary thoughts of what any 
public move on her part would certainly not probably but immediately involve eugene was well 
known to kill him which was really very far from her thoughts in any save 
a very secret way would create a tremendous sensation and involve no end of examination 
discussion excited publicity to expose him to either colfax or winfield meant in reality exposing 
suzanne to them and possibly to members of her own social set for these men 
were of it and might talk eugene's resignation would cause comment if he left suzanne 
might run away with himthen what there was the thought on her part that the 
least discussion or whisper of this to anybody might produce the most disastrous results what 
capital the socalled yellow newspapers would make out of a story of this character how 
they would gloat over the details it was a most terrible and dangerous situation and 
yet it was plain that something had to be done and that immediately what in 
this crisis it occurred to her that several things might be done and that without 
great danger of irremediable consequences if she could only have a little time in which 
suzanne would promise to remain quiescent and do so if she could get her to 
say that she would do nothing for ten days or five days all might be 
well for them she could go to see angela eugene mr colfax if necessary to 
leave suzanne in order to go on these various errands she had to obtain suzanne's 
word which she knew she could respect absolutely that she would make no move of 
any kind until the time was up under pretense that suzanne herself needed time to 
think or should take it she pleaded and pleaded until finally the girl on condition 
that she be allowed to phone to eugene and state how things stood consented eugene 
had called her up on the second day after the quarrel began and had been 
informed by the butler at mrs dale's request that she was out of town he 
called the second day and got the same answer he wrote to her and mrs 
dale hid the letter but on the fourth day suzanne called him up and explained 
the moment she did so he was sorry that she had been so hasty in 
telling her mother terribly so but there was nothing to be done now save to 
stand by his guns he was ready in a grim way to rise or fall 
so long as in doing either he should obtain his heart's desire shall i come 
and help you argue he asked no not for five days i have given my 
word shall i see you no not for five days eugene mayn't i even call 
you up no not for five days after that yes all right flower facedivine fire 
i'll obey i'm yours to command but oh sweet it's a long time i know 
but it will pass and you won't change no they can't make you no you 
know they can't dearest why do you ask oh i can't help feeling a little 
fearful sweet you are so young so new to love i won't change i won't 
change i don't need to swear i won't very well then myrtle bloom she hung 
up the receiver and mrs dale knew now that her greatest struggle was before her 
her several contemplated moves consisted first in going to see mrs witla unknown to suzanne 
and eugene learning what she knew of how things were and what she would advise 
this really did no good unless the fact that it fomented anew the rage and 
grief of angela and gave mrs dale additional material wherewith to belabor eugene could be 
said to be of advantage angela who had been arguing and pleading with eugene all 
this time endeavoring by one thought and another to awaken him to a sense of 
the enormity of the offense he was contemplating was practically in despair she had reached 
the point where she had become rather savage again and he also in spite of 
her condition in spite of all she could say he was cold and bitter so 
insistent that he was through with the old order that he made her angry instead 
of leaving him as she might have done trusting to time to alter his attitude 
or to teach her the wisdom of releasing him entirely she preferred to cling to 
him for there was still affection left she was used to him he was the 
father of her coming child unwelcome as it was he represented her social position to 
her her station in the world why should she leave him then too there was 
this fear of the outcome which would come over her like a child she might 
die what would become of the child you know mrs dale she said at one 
point significantly i don't hold suzanne absolutely guiltless she is old enough to know better 
she has been out in society long enough to know that a married man is 
sacred property to another woman i know i know replied mrs dale resentfully but cautiously 
but suzanne is so young you really don't know how much of a child she 
is and she has this silly idealistic emotional disposition i suspected something of it but 
i did not know it was so strong i'm sure i don't know where she 
gets it her father was most practical but she was all right until your husband 
persuaded her that may be all true went on angela but she is not guiltless 
i know eugene he is weak but he will not follow where he is not 
led and no girl need be tempted unless she wants to suzanne is so young 
again pleaded mrs dale well i'm sure if she knew mr witla's record accurately went 
on angela foolishly she wouldn't want him i have written her she ought to know 
he isn't honest and he isn't moral as this thing shows if this were the 
first time he had fallen in love with another woman i could forgive him but 
it isn't he did something quite as bad six or seven years ago and only 
two years before that there was another woman he wouldn't be faithful to suzanne if 
he had her it would be a case of blazing affection for a little while 
and then he would tire and cast her aside why you can tell what sort 
of a man he is when he would propose to me as he did here 
that i should let him maintain a separate establishment for suzanne and say nothing of 
it the idea mrs dale clicked her lips significantly she considered angela foolish for talking 
in this way but it could not be helped now possibly eugene had made a 
mistake in marrying her this did not excuse him however in her eyes for wanting 
to take suzanne under the conditions he proposed if he were free it would be 
an entirely different matter his standing his mind his manners were not objectionable though he 
was not to the manner born mrs dale went away toward evening greatly nonplussed by 
what she had seen and heard but convinced that no possible good could come of 
the situation angela would never give him a divorce eugene was not a fit man 
morally for her daughter anyhow there was great scandal on the verge of exposure here 
in which her beloved daughter would be irretrievably smirched in her desperation she decided if 
she could do no better she would try to dissuade eugene from seeing suzanne until 
he could obtain a divorce in which case to avoid something worse she would agree 
to a marriage but this was only to be a lip promise the one thing 
she wanted to do was to get suzanne to give him up entirely if suzanne 
could be spirited away or dissuaded from throwing herself away on eugene that would be 
the thing still she proposed to see what a conversation with eugene would do the 
next morning as he was sitting in his office wondering what the delay of five 
days portended and what suzanne was doing as well as trying to fix his mind 
on the multitudinous details which required his constant attention and were now being rather markedly 
neglected the card of mrs emily dale was laid on his table and a few 
moments later after his secretary had been dismissed and word given that no one else 
was to be allowed to enter mrs dale was shown in she was pale and 
weary but exquisitely dressed in a greenish blue silk and picture hat of black straw 
and feathers she looked quite young and handsome herself not too old for eugene and 
indeed once she had fancied he might well fall in love with her what her 
thoughts were at that time she was not now willing to recall for they had 
involved the probable desertion or divorce or death of angela and eugene's passionate infatuation for 
her all that was over now of course and in the excitement and distress almost 
completely obliterated eugene had not forgotten that he had had similar sensations or imaginations at 
the time and that mrs dale had always drawn to him in a sympathetic and 
friendly way here she was though this morning coming upon a desperate mission no doubt 
and he would have to contend with her as best he could the conversation opened 
by his looking into her set face as she approached and smiling blandly though it 
was something of an effort well he said in quite a business like way what 
can i do for you you villain she exclaimed melodramatically my daughter has told me 
all yes suzanne phoned me that she told you he replied in a conciliatory tone 
yes she said in a low tense voice and i ought to kill you where 
you stand to think that i should have ever harbored such a monster as you 
in my home and near my dear innocent daughter it seems incredible now i can't 
believe it that you should dare and you with a dear sweet wife at home 
sick and in the condition she is in i should think if you had any 
manhood at all any sense of shame when i think of that poor dear little 
woman and what you have been doing or trying to doif it weren't for the 
scandal you would never leave this office alive oh bother don't talk rot mrs dale 
said eugene quietly though irritably he did not care for her melodramatic attitude the dear 
darling little woman you speak of is not as badly off as you think and 
i don't think she needs as much of your sympathy as you are so anxious 
to give she is pretty well able to take care of herself sick as she 
is as for killing me you or anyone else well that wouldn't be such a 
bad idea i'm not so much in love with life this is not fifty years 
ago though but the nineteenth century and this is new york city i love suzanne 
she loves me we want each other desperately now an arrangement can be made which 
will not interfere with you in any way and which will adjust things for us 
suzanne is anxious to make that arrangement it is as much her proposition as it 
is mine why should you be so vastly disturbed you know a great deal about 
life why should i be disturbed why should i can you sit in this office 
you a man in charge of all this vast public work and ask me in 
cold blood why i should be disturbed and my daughter's very life at stake why 
should i be disturbed and my daughter only out of her short dresses a little 
while ago and practically innocent of the world you dare to tell me that she 
proposed oh you impervious scoundrel to think i could be so mistaken in any human 
being you with your bland manners and your inconsistent talk of happy family life i 
might have understood though when i saw you so often without your wife i should 
have known i did god help me but i didn't act upon it i was 
taken by your bland gentlemanly attitude i don't blame poor dear little suzanne i blame 
you you utterly deceiving villain and myself for being so silly i am being justly 
rewarded however eugene merely looked at her and drummed with his fingers but i did 
not come here to bandy words with you she went on i came to say 
that you must never see my daughter again or speak of her or appear where 
she might chance to be though she won't be where you may appear if i 
have my way for you won't have a chance to appear anywhere in decent society 
very much longer i shall go unless you agree here and now never to see 
or communicate with her any more to mr colfax whom i know personally as you 
are aware and lay the whole matter before him i'm sure with what i know 
now of your record and what you have attempted to do in connection with my 
daughter and the condition of your wife that he will not require your services very 
much longer i shall go to mr winfield who is also an old friend and 
lay the matter before him privately you will be drummed out of society and my 
daughter will be none the worse for it she is so very young that when 
the facts are known you are the only one who will bear the odium of 
this your wife has given me your wretched record only yesterday you would like to 
make my suzanne your fourth or fifth well you will not i will show you 
something you have not previously known you are dealing with a desperate mother defy me 
if you dare i demand that you write your farewell to suzanne here and now 
and let me take it to her eugene smiled sardonically mrs dale's reference to angela 
made him bitter she had been there and angela had talked of himhis past to 
her what a mean thing to do after all angela was his wife only the 
morning before she had been appealing to him on the grounds of love and she 
had not told him of mrs dale's visit love love what sort of love was 
this he had done enough for her to make her generous in a crisis like 
this even if she did not want to be write you a statement of release 
to suzanne he observed his lips curlinghow silly of course i won't and as for 
your threat to run to mr colfax i have heard that before from mrs witla 
there is the door his office is twelve flights down i'll call a boy if 
you wish you tell it to mr colfax and see how much farther it goes 
before you are much older run to mr winfield also a lot i care about 
him or mr colfax if you want a grand interesting discussion of this thing just 
begin it will go far and wide i assure you i love your daughter i'm 
desperate about her i'm literally crazy about herhe got upshe loves me or i think 
she does anyhow i'm banking all on that thought my life from the point of 
view of affection has been a failure i have never really been in love before 
but i am crazy about suzanne dale i am wild about her if you had 
any sympathy for an unhappy sympathetic emotional mortal who has never yet been satisfied in 
a woman you would give her to me i love her i love her by 
godhe banged the desk with his fisti will do anything for her if she will 
come to me colfax can have his position winfield can have his blue sea corporation 
you can have her money if she wants to give it to you i can 
make a living abroad by my art and i will other americans have done it 
before me i love her i love her do you hear me i love her 
and what's more i'm going to have her you can't stop me you haven't the 
brains you haven't the strength you haven't the resources to match that girl she's brighter 
than you are she's stronger she's finer she's finer than the whole current day conception 
of society and life she loves me and she wants to give herself to me 
willingly freely joyously match that in your petty society circles if you can society you 
say you will have me drummed out of it will you a lot i care 
about your society hacks mental light weights money grubbers gamblers thieves leechesa fine lot to 
see you sitting there and talking to me with your grand air makes me laugh 
a lot i care for you i was thinking of another kind of woman when 
i met you not a narrow conventional fool i thought i saw one in you 
i did didn't inot you are like all the rest a narrow petty slavish follower 
after fashion and convention well he snapped his fingers in her face go on and 
do your worst i will get suzanne in the long run she will come to 
me she will dominate you run to colfax run to winfield i will get her 
just the same she's mine she belongs to me she is big enough for me 
the gods have given her to me and i will have her if i have 
to smash you and your home and myself and everyone else connected with me i'll 
have her i'll have her she is mine she is mine he lifted a tense 
hand now you run and do anything you want to thank god i've found one 
woman who knows how to live and love she's mine mrs dale stared at him 
in amazement scarcely believing her ears was he crazy was he really so much in 
love had suzanne turned his brain what an astonishing thing she had never seen him 
anything like thisnever imagined him capable of anything like it he was always so quiet 
smiling bland witty here he was dramatic impassioned fiery hungry there was a terrible light 
in his eyes and he was desperate he must be in love oh why will 
you do this to me she whimpered all at once the terror of his mood 
conveying itself to her for the moment and arousing a sympathy which she had not 
previously felt why will you come into my home and attempt to destroy it there 
are lots of women who will love you there are lots more suited to your 
years and temperament than suzanne she doesn't understand you she doesn't understand herself she is 
just young and foolish and hypnotized you have hypnotized her oh why will you do 
this to me you are so much older than her so much more schooled in 
life why not give her up i don't want to go to mr colfax i 
don't want to speak to mr winfield i will if i have to but i 
don't want to i have always thought so well of you i know you are 
not an ordinary man restore my respect for you my confidence in you i can 
forgive if i can't forget you may not be happily married i am sorry for 
you i don't want to do anything desperate i only want to save poor little 
suzanne oh please please i love her so i don't think you understand how i 
feel you may be in love but you ought to be willing to consider others 
true love would i know that she is hard and wilful and desperate now but 
she will change if you will help her why if you really love her if 
you have any sympathy for me or regard for her future or your own you 
will renounce your schemes and release her tell her you made a mistake write to 
her now tell her you can't do this and not socially ruin her and me 
and yourself and so you won't do it tell her that you have decided to 
wait until time has made you a free man if that is to be and 
then let her have a chance of seeing if she will not be happy in 
a normal life you don't want to ruin her at this age do you she 
is so young so innocent oh if you have any judgment of life at all 
any regard any consideration anything i beg of you i beg as her mother for 
i love her oh tears came into her eyes again and she cried weakly in 
her handkerchief eugene stared at her what was he doing where was he going was 
he really as bad as he appeared to be here was he possessed was he 
really so hardhearted through her grief and angela's and the threats concerning colfax and winfield 
he caught a glimpse of the real heart of the situation it was as if 
there had been a great flash of lightning illuminating a black landscape he saw sympathetically 
sorrow folly a number of things that were involved and then the next moment it 
was gone suzanne's face came back smooth classic chiseled perfectly modeled her beauty like a 
tightened bow her eyes her lips her hair the gaiety and buoyancy of her motions 
and her smile give her up give up suzanne and that dream of the studio 
and of joyous continuous delicious companionship did suzanne want him to what had she said 
over the phone no no no quit now and her clinging to him no no 
no never he would fight first he would go down fighting never never never his 
brain seethed i can't do it he said getting up again for he had sat 
down after his previous tirade i can't do it you are asking something that is 
utterly impossible it can never be done god help me i'm insane i'm wild over 
her go and do anything you want to but i must have her and i 
will she's mine she's mine she's mine his thin lean hands clenched and he clicked 
his teeth mine mine mine he muttered and one would have thought him a villain 
in a cheap melodrama mrs dale shook her head god help us both she said 
you shall never never have her you are not worthy of her you are not 
right in your mind i will fight you with all the means in my power 
i am desperate i am wealthy i know how to fight you shall not have 
her now we will see which will win she rose to go and eugene followed 
her go ahead he said calmly but in the end you lose suzanne comes to 
me i know it i feel it i may lose many other things but i 
get her she's mine oh sighed mrs dale wearily half believing him and moving towards 
the door is this your last word it is positively then i must be going 
goodbye he said solemnly goodbye she answered white faced her eyes staring she went out 
and eugene took up the telephone but he remembered that suzanne had warned him not 
to call but to depend on her so he put it down again chapter xv 
the fire and pathos of mrs dale's appeal should have given eugene pause he thought 
once of going after her and making a further appeal saying that he would try 
and get a divorce eventually and marry suzanne but he remembered that peculiar insistency of 
suzanne on the fact that she did not want to get married somehow somewhere somewhy 
she had formulated this peculiar ideal or attitude which whatever the world might think of 
it was possible of execution providing he and she were tactful enough it was not 
such a wild thing for two people to want to come together in this way 
if they chose he thought why was it heaven could witness there were enough illicit 
and peculiar relationships in this world to prevent society from becoming excited about one more 
particularly when it was to be conducted in so circumspect and subtle a way he 
and suzanne did not intend to blazon their relationship to the world as a distinguished 
artist not active but acknowledged and accomplished he was entitled to a studio life he 
and suzanne could meet there nothing would be thought of it why had she insisted 
on telling her mother it could all have been done without that there was another 
peculiar ideal of hers her determination to tell the truth under all circumstances and yet 
she had really not told it she had deceived her mother a long time about 
him simply by saying nothing was this some untoward trick of fate's merely devised to 
harm him surely not and yet suzanne's headstrong determination seemed almost a fatal mistake now 
he sat down brooding over it was this a terrific blunder would he be sorry 
all his life was in the balance should he turn back no no no never 
it was not to be he must go on he must he must so he 
brooded the next of mrs dale's resources was not quite so unavailing as the others 
though it was almost so she had sent for dr latson woolley her family physicianan 
old school practitioner of great repute of rigid honor and rather christian principles himself but 
also of a wide intellectual and moral discernment so far as others were concerned well 
mrs dale he observed when he was ushered into her presence in the library on 
the ground floor and extending his hand cordially though wearily what can i do for 
you this morning oh dr woolley she began directly i am in so much trouble 
it isn't a case of sickness i wish it were it is something so much 
worse i have sent for you because i know i can rely on your judgment 
and sympathy it concerns my daughter suzanne yes yes he grunted in a rather crusty 
voice for his vocal cords were old and his eyes looked out from under shaggy 
gray eyebrows which somehow bespoke a world of silent observation what's the matter with her 
what has she done now that she ought not to do oh doctor exclaimed mrs 
dale nervously for the experiences of the last few days had almost completely dispelled her 
normal composure i don't know how to tell you really i don't know how to 
begin suzanne my dear precious suzanne in whom i have placed so much faith and 
reliance has has well tell me interrupted dr woolley laconically when she had told him 
the whole story and answered some of his incisive questions he said: well i am 
thinking you have a good deal to be grateful for she might have yielded without 
your knowledge and told you afterwardsor not at all not at all oh doctor my 
suzanne mrs dale i looked after you and your mother before you and suzanne i 
know something about human nature and your family characteristics your husband was a very determined 
man as you will remember suzanne may have some of his traits in her she 
is a very young girl you want to remember very robust and vigorous how old 
is this witla man about thirtyeight or nine doctor um i suspected as much the 
fatal age it's a wonder you came through that period as safely as you did 
you're nearly forty aren't you yes doctor but you're the only one that knows it 
i know i know it's the fatal age you say he is in charge of 
the united magazines corporation i have probably heard of him i know of mr colfax 
of that company is he very emotional in his temperament i had never thought so 
before this well he probably is thirtyeight to thirtynine and eighteen or nineteenbad combination where 
is suzanne upstairs in her room i fancy it might not be a bad thing 
if i talked to her myself a little though i don't believe it will do 
any good mrs dale disappeared and was gone for nearly threequarters of an hour suzanne 
was stubborn irritable and to all preliminary entreaties insisted that she would not why should 
her mother call in outsiders particularly dr woolley whom she knew and liked she suspected 
at once when her mother said dr woolley wanted to see her that it had 
something to do with her case and demanded to know why finally after much pleading 
she consented to come down though it was with the intention of showing her mother 
how ridiculous all her excitement was the old doctor who had been meditating upon the 
inexplicable tangle chemical and physical of lifethe blowing hither and thither of diseases affections emotions 
and hates of all kinds looked up quizzically as suzanne entered well suzanne he said 
genially rising and walking slowly toward her i'm glad to see you again how are 
you this morning pretty well doctor how are you oh as you see as you 
see a little older and a little fussier suzanne making other people's troubles my own 
your mother tells me you have fallen in love that's an interesting thing to do 
isn't it you know doctor said suzanne defiantly i told mama that i don't care 
to discuss this and i don't think she has any right to try to make 
me i don't want to and i won't i think it is all in rather 
poor taste poor taste suzanne asked mrs dale do you call our discussion of what 
you want to do poor taste when the world will think that what you want 
to do is terrible when you do it i told you mama that i was 
not coming down here to discuss this thing and i'm not said suzanne turning to 
her mother and ignoring dr woolley i'm not going to stay i don't want to 
offend dr woolley but i'm not going to stay and have you argue this all 
over again she turned to go there there mrs dale don't interrupt observed dr woolley 
holding suzanne by the very tone of his voice i think myself that very little 
is to be gained by argument suzanne is convinced that what she is planning to 
do is to her best interest it may be we can't always tell i think 
the best thing that could be discussed if anything at all in this matter can 
be discussed is the matter of time it is my opinion that before doing this 
thing that suzanne wants to do and which may be all right for all i 
know it would be best if she would take a little time i know nothing 
of mr witla he may be a most able and worthy man suzanne ought to 
give herself a little time to think though i should say three months or six 
months a great many after effects hang on this decision as you know he said 
turning to suzanne it may involve responsibilities you are not quite ready to shoulder you 
are only eighteen or nineteen you know you might have to give up dancing and 
society and travel and a great many things and devote yourself to being a mother 
and ministering to your husband's needs you expect to live with him permanently don't you 
i don't want to discuss this dr woolley but you do expect that don't you 
only as long as we love each other um well you might love him for 
some little time yet you rather expect to do that don't you why yes but 
what is the good of this anyhow my mind is made up just the matter 
of thinking said dr woolley very soothingly and in a voice which disarmed suzanne and 
held her just a little time in which to be absolutely sure your mother is 
anxious not to have you do it at all you as i understand it want 
to do this thing right away your mother loves you and at bottom in spite 
of this little difference i know you love her it just occurred to me that 
for the sake of good feeling all around you might like to strike a balance 
you might be willing to take say six months or a year and think about 
it mr witla would probably not object you won't be any the less delightful to 
him at the end of that time and as for your mother she would feel 
a great deal better if she thought that after all what you decided to do 
you had done after mature deliberation yes exclaimed mrs dale impulsively do take time to 
think suzanne a year won't hurt you no said suzanne unguardedly it is all a 
matter of whether i want to or not i don't want to precisely still this 
is something you might take into consideration the situation from all outside points of view 
is serious i haven't said so but i feel that you would be making a 
great mistake still that is only my opinion you are entitled to yours i know 
how you feel about it but the public is not likely to feel quite the 
same the public is a wearisome thing suzanne but we have to take it into 
consideration suzanne stared stubbornly and wearily at her tormentors their logic did not appeal to 
her at all she was thinking of eugene and her plan it could be worked 
what did she care about the world during all this talk she drew nearer and 
nearer the door and finally opened it well that is all said dr woolley when 
he saw she was determined to go good morning suzanne i am glad to have 
seen you again good morning dr woolley she replied she went out and mrs dale 
wrung her hands i wish i knew what was to be done she exclaimed gazing 
at her counselor dr woolley brooded over the folly of undesired human counsel there is 
no need for excitement he observed after a time it is obvious to me that 
if she is handled rightly she will wait she is in a state of high 
strung opposition and emotion for some reason at present you have driven her too hard 
relax let her think this thing out for herself counsel for delay but don't irritate 
you cannot control her by driving she has too stern a will tears won't help 
emotion seems a little silly to her ask her to think or better yet let 
her think and plead only for delay if you could get her away for two 
or three weeks or months off by herself undisturbed by your pleadings and uninfluenced by 
hisif she would ask him of her own accord to let her alone for that 
time all will be well i don't think she will ever go to him she 
thinks she will but i have the feeling that she won't however be calm if 
you can get her to go away would it be possible to lock her up 
in some sanatorium or asylum doctor until she has had time to think all things 
are possible but i should say it would be the most inadvisable thing you could 
do force accomplishes nothing in these cases i know but suppose she won't listen to 
reason you really haven't come to that bridge yet you haven't talked calmly to her 
yet you are quarreling with her there is very little in that you will simply 
grow further and further apart how practical you are doctor observed mrs dale in a 
mollified and complimentary vein not practical but intuitional if i were practical i would never 
have taken up medicine he walked to the door his old body sinking in somewhat 
upon itself his old gray eyes twinkled slightly as he turned you were in love 
once mrs dale he said yes she replied you remember how you felt then yes 
be reasonable remember your own sensationsyour own attitude you probably weren't crossed in your affair 
she is she has made a mistake be patient be calm we want to stop 
it and no doubt can do unto others as you would be done by he 
ambled shufflingly across the piazza and down the wide steps to his car mama she 
said when after dr woolley had gone her mother came to her room to see 
if she might not be in a mellower mood and to plead with her further 
for delay it seems to me you are making a ridiculous mess of all this 
why should you go and tell dr woolley about me i will never forgive you 
for that mama you have done something i never thought you would do i thought 
you had more pridemore individuality one should have seen suzanne in her spacious boudoir her 
back to her oval mirrored dressing table her face fronting her mother to understand her 
fascination for eugene it was a lovely sunny many windowed chamber and suzanne in a 
white and blue morning dress was in charming accord with the gay atmosphere of the 
room well suzanne you know she said rather despondently i just couldn't help it i 
had to go to someone i am quite alone apart from you and kinroy and 
the childrenshe referred to adele and ninette as the children when talking to either suzanne 
or kinroyand i didn't want to say anything to them you have been my only 
confidant up to now and since you have turned against me i haven't turned against 
you mama oh yes you have let's not talk about it suzanne you have broken 
my heart you are killing me i just had to go to someone we have 
known dr woolley so long he is so good and kind oh i know mama 
but what good will it do how can anything he might say help matters he 
isn't going to change me you're only telling it to somebody who oughtn't to know 
anything about it but i thought he might influence you pleaded mrs dale i thought 
you would listen to him oh dear oh dear i'm so tired of it all 
i wish i were dead i wish i had never lived to see this now 
there you go mama said suzanne confidently i can't see why you are so distressed 
about what i am going to do it is my life that i am planning 
to arrange not yours i have to live my life mama not you oh yes 
but it is just that that distresses me what will it be after you do 
thisafter you throw it away oh if you could only see what you are contemplating 
doingwhat a wretched thing it will be when it is all over with you will 
never live with himhe is too old for you too fickle too insincere he will 
not care for you after a little while and then there you will be unmarried 
possibly with a child on your hands a social outcast where will you go mama 
said suzanne calmly her lips parted in a rosy baby way i have thought of 
all this i see how it is but i think you and everybody else make 
too much ado about these things you think of everything that could happen but it 
doesn't all happen that way people do these things i'm sure and nothing much is 
thought of it yes in books put in mrs dale i know where you get 
all this from it's your reading anyhow i'm going to i have made up my 
mind added suzanne i have decided that by september fifteenth i will go to mr 
witla and you might just as well make up your mind to it now this 
was august tenth suzanne said her mother staring at her i never imagined you could 
talk in this way to me you will do nothing of the kind how can 
you be so hard i did not know that you had such a terrible will 
in you doesn't anything i have said about adele and ninette or kinroy appeal to 
you have you no heart in you why don't you wait as dr woolley suggests 
six months or a year why do you talk about jumping into this without giving 
yourself time to think it is such a wild rash experiment you haven't thought anything 
about it you haven't had time oh yes i have mama replied suzanne i've thought 
a great deal about it i'm fully convinced i want to do it then because 
i told eugene that i would not keep him waiting long and i won't i 
want to go to him that will make a clear two months since we first 
talked of this mrs dale winced she had no idea of yielding to her daughter 
or letting her do this but this definite conclusion as to the time brought matters 
finally to a head her daughter was out of her mind that was all it 
gave her not any too much time to turn round in she must get suzanne 
out of the cityout of the country if possible or lock her up and she 
must do it without antagonizing her too much chapter xvi mrs dale's next step in 
this struggle was to tell kinroy who wanted of course in a fit of boyish 
chivalry to go immediately and kill eugene this was prevented by mrs dale who had 
more control over him than she had over suzanne pointing out to him what a 
terrifically destructive scandal would ensue and urging subtlety and patience kinroy had a sincere affection 
for his sisters particularly suzanne and adele and he wanted to protect all of them 
he decided in a pompous ultra chivalrous spirit that he must help his mother plan 
and together they talked of chloroforming her some night of carrying her thus as a 
sick girl in a private car to maine or the adirondacks or somewhere in canada 
it would be useless to follow all these strategic details in their order there were 
after the five days agreed upon by suzanne attempted phone messages by eugene which were 
frustrated by kinroy who was now fulfilling the rôle of private detective suzanne resolved to 
have eugene summoned to the house for a discussion but to this her mother objected 
she felt that additional meetings would simply strengthen their bond of union kinroy wrote to 
eugene of his own accord that he knew all and that if he attempted to 
come near the place he would kill him at sight suzanne finding herself blocked and 
detained by her mother wrote eugene a letter which elizabeth her maid secretly conveyed to 
the mail for her telling him how things stood her mother had told dr woolley 
and kinroy she had decided that september fifteenth was the time she would leave home 
unless their companionship was quietly sanctioned kinroy had threatened to kill him to her but 
she did not think he had anything to fear kinroy was just excited her mother 
wanted her to go to europe for six months and think it over but this 
she would not do she was not going to leave the city and he need 
not fear if he did not hear anything for a few days at a time 
that anything was wrong with her they must wait until the storm subsided a little 
i shall be here but perhaps it is best for you not to try to 
see me just now when the time comes i will come to you and if 
i get a chance i will see you before eugene was both pained and surprised 
at the turn things had taken but still encouraged to hope for the best by 
the attitude suzanne took toward it all her courage strengthened him she was calm so 
purposeful what a treasure she was so began a series of daily love notes for 
a few days until suzanne advised him to cease there were constant arguments between her 
her mother and kinroy because she was being so obviously frustrated she began to grow 
bitter and hard and short contradictory phrases passed between her and her mother principally originating 
in suzanne no no no was her constantly reiterated statement i won't do it what 
of it it's silly let me alone i won't talk so it went mrs dale 
was planning hourly how to abduct her chloroforming and secret removal after the fashion she 
had in her mind was not so easy of accomplishment it was such a desperate 
thing to do to suzanne she was afraid she might die under its influence it 
could not be administered without a doctor the servants would think it strange she fancied 
there were whispered suspicions already finally she thought of pretending to agree with suzanne removing 
all barriers and asking her to come to albany to confer with her guardian or 
rather the legal representative of the marquardt trust company which held her share of her 
father the late westfield dale's estate in trust for her in regard to some property 
in western new york which belonged to her mrs dale decided to pretend to be 
obliged to go to albany in order to have suzanne sign a waiver of right 
to any share in her mother's private estate after which supposedly she would give suzanne 
her freedom having also disinherited her in her will suzanne according to this scheme was 
then to come back to new york and go her way and her mother was 
not to see her any more to make this more effective kinroy was sent to 
tell her of her mother's plan and beg her for her own and her family's 
sake not to let the final separation come about mrs dale changed her manner kinroy 
acted his part so effectively that what with her mother's resigned look and indifferent method 
of address suzanne was partly deceived she imagined her mother had experienced a complete change 
of heart and might be going to do what kinroy said no she replied to 
kinroy's pleadings i don't care whether she cuts me off i'll be very glad to 
sign the papers if she wants me to go away i'll go i think she 
has acted very foolishly through all this and so have you i wish you wouldn't 
let her do that observed kinroy who was rather exulting over the satisfactory manner in 
which this bait was being swallowed mama is broken hearted she wants you to stay 
here to wait six months or a year before you do anything at all but 
if you won't she's going to ask you to do this i've tried to persuade 
her not to i'd hate like anything to see you go won't you change your 
mind i told you i wouldn't kinroy don't ask me kinroy went back to his 
mother and reported that suzanne was stubborn as ever but that the trick would in 
all probability work she would go aboard the train thinking she was going to albany 
once aboard inside a closed car she would scarcely suspect until the next morning and 
then they would be far in the adirondack mountains the scheme worked in part her 
mother as had kinroy went through this prearranged scene as well as though she were 
on the stage suzanne fancied she saw her freedom near at hand only a travelling 
bag was packed and suzanne went willingly enough into the auto and the train only 
stipulating one thingthat she be allowed to call up eugene and explain both kinroy and 
her mother objected but when finally she refused flatly to go without they acceded she 
called him up at the officeit was four o'clock in the afternoon and they were 
leaving at fivethirtyand told him he fancied at once it was a ruse and told 
her so but she thought not mrs dale had never lied to her before neither 
had her brother their words were as bonds eugene says this is a trap mama 
said suzanne turning from the phone to her mother who was near by is it 
you know it isn't replied her mother lying unblushingly if it is it will come 
to nothing she replied and eugene heard her he was strengthened into acquiescence by the 
tone of her voice surely she was a wonderful girla master of men and women 
in her way very well if you think it's all right said eugene but i'll 
be very lonely i've been so already i shall be more so flower face unless 
i see you soon oh if the time were only up it will be eugene 
she replied in a very few days now i'll be back thursday and then you 
can come down and see me thursday afternoon yes we're to be back thursday morning 
she finally hung up the receiver and they entered the automobile and an hour later 
the train chapter xvii it was a montreal ottawa and quebec express and it ran 
without stopping to albany by the time it was nearing the latter place suzanne was 
going to bedand because it was a private carmrs dale explained that the president of 
the road had lent it to herno announcement of its arrival which would have aroused 
suzanne was made by the porter when it stopped there shortly after ten o'clock it 
was the last car at the south end of the train and you could hear 
voices calling but just what it was was not possible to say suzanne who had 
already gone to bed fancied it might be poughkeepsie or some wayside station her mother's 
statement was that since they arrived so late the car would be switched to a 
siding and they would stay aboard until morning nevertheless she and kinroy were alert to 
prevent any untoward demonstration or decision on suzanne's part and so as the train went 
on she slept soundly until burlington in the far northern part of vermont was reached 
the next morning when she awoke and saw that the train was still speeding on 
she wondered vaguely but not clearly what it could mean there were mountains about or 
rather tall pinecovered hills mountain streams were passed on high trestles and sections of burned 
woodlands were passed where forest fires had left lonely sad charred stretches of tree trunks 
towering high in the air suddenly it occurred to suzanne that this was peculiar and 
she came out of the bath to ask why where are we mama she asked 
mrs dale was leaning back in a comfortable willow chair reading or pretending to read 
a book kinroy was out on the observation platform for a moment he came back 
though shortly for he was nervous as to what suzanne would do when she discovered 
her whereabouts a hamper of food had been put aboard the night before unknown to 
suzanne and mrs dale was going shortly to serve breakfast she had not risked a 
maid on this journey i don't know replied her mother indifferently looking out at a 
stretch of burnt woods i thought we were to be in albany a little after 
midnight said suzanne so we were replied mrs dale preparing to confess kinroy came back 
into the car well then said suzanne pausing looking first out of the windows and 
then fixedly at her mother it came to her as she saw the unsettled somewhat 
nervous expression in her mother's face and eyes and in kinroy's that this was a 
trick and that she was being taken somewherewhereagainst her will this is a trick mama 
she said to her mother grandly you have lied to meyou and kinroy we are 
not going to albany at all where are we going i don't want to tell 
you now suzanne replied mrs dale quietly have your bath and we'll talk about it 
afterwards it doesn't matter we're going up into canada if you want to know we 
are nearly there now you'll know fast enough when we get there mama replied suzanne 
this is a despicable trick you are going to be sorry for this you have 
lied to meyou and kinroy i see it now i might have known but i 
didn't believe you would lie to me mama i can't do anything just now i 
see that very plainly but when the time comes you are going to be sorry 
you can't control me this way you ought to know better you yourself are going 
to take me back to new york and she fixed her mother with a steady 
look which betokened a mastership which her mother felt nervously and wearily she might eventually 
be compelled to acknowledge now suzanne what's the use of talking that way pleaded kinroy 
mama is almost crazy as it is she couldn't think of any other way or 
thing to do you hush kinroy replied suzanne i don't care to talk to you 
you have lied to me and that is more than i ever did to you 
mama i am astonished at you she returned to her mother my mother lying to 
me very well mama you have things in your hands today i will have them 
in mine later you have taken just the wrong course now you wait and see 
mrs dale winced and quailed this girl was the most unterrified determined fighter she had 
ever known she wondered where she got her couragefrom her late husband probably she could 
actually feel the quietness grit lack of fear which had grown up in her during 
the last few weeks under the provocation which antagonism had provided please don't talk that 
way suzanne she pleaded i have done it all for your own good you know 
i have why will you torture me you know i won't give you up to 
that man i won't i'll move heaven and earth first i'll die in this struggle 
but i won't give you up then you'll die mama for i'm going to do 
what i said you can take me to where this car stops but you can't 
take me out of it i'm going back to new york now a lot you 
have accomplished haven't you suzanne i am convinced almost that you are out of your 
mind you have almost driven me out of mine but i am still sane enough 
to see what is right mama i don't propose to talk to you any more 
or to kinroy you can take me back to new york or you can leave 
me but you will not get me out of this car i am done with 
listening to nonsense and pretences you have lied to me once you will not get 
a chance to do it again i don't care suzanne replied her mother as the 
train sped swiftly along you have forced me to do this it is your own 
attitude that is causing all the trouble if you would be reasonable and take some 
time to think this all over you would not be where you are now i 
won't let you do this thing that you want to do you can stay in 
the car if you wish but you cannot be taken back to new york without 
money i will speak to the station agent about that suzanne thought of this she 
had no money no clothes other than those she had on she was in a 
strange country and not so very used to travelling alone she had really gone to 
very few places in times past by herself it took the edge off her determination 
to resist but she was not conquered by any means how are you going to 
get back asked her mother after a time when suzanne paid no attention to her 
you have no money surely suzanne you are not going to make a scene i 
only want you to come up here for a few weeks so that you will 
have time to think away from that man i don't want you to go to 
him on september the fifteenth i just won't let you do that why won't you 
be reasonable you can have a pleasant time up here you like to ride you 
are welcome to do that i will ride with you you can invite some of 
your friends up here if you choose i will send for your clothes only stay 
here a while and think over what you are going to do suzanne refused to 
talk she was thinking what she could do eugene was back in new york he 
would expect her thursday yes suzanne put in kinroy why not take ma's advice she's 
trying to do the best thing by you this is a terrible thing you are 
trying to do why not listen to common sense and stay up here three or 
four months don't talk like a parrot kinroy i'm hearing all this from mama when 
her mother reproached her she said: oh hush mama i don't care to hear anything 
more i won't do anything of the sort you lied to me you said you 
were going to albany you brought me out here under a pretence now you can 
take me back i won't go to any lodge i won't go anywhere except to 
new york you might just as well not argue with me the train rolled on 
breakfast was served the private car was switched to the tracks of the canadian pacific 
at montreal her mother's pleas continued suzanne refused to eat she sat and looked out 
of the window meditating over this strange dénouement where was eugene what was he doing 
what would he think when she did not come back she was not enraged at 
her mother she was merely contemptuous of her this trick irritated and disgusted her she 
was not thinking of eugene in any wild way but merely that she would get 
back to him she conceived of him much as she did of herself though her 
conception of her real self was still vague as strong patient resourceful able to live 
without her a little while if he had to she was eager to see him 
but really more eager that he should see her if he wanted to what a 
creature he must take her mother to be by noon they had reached juinata by 
two o'clock they were fifty miles west of quebec at first suzanne thought she would 
not eat at all to spite her mother later she reasoned that that was silly 
and ate she made it exceedingly unpleasant for them by her manner and they realized 
that by bringing her away from new york they had merely transferred their troubles her 
spirit was not broken as yet it filled the car with a disturbing vibration suzanne 
questioned her mother at one point won't you talk to me won't you see i'm 
trying to do this for your own good i want to give you time to 
think i really don't want to coerce you but you must see suzanne merely stared 
out of the window at the green fields speeding by suzanne don't you see this 
will never do can't you see how terrible it all is mama i want you 
to let me alone you have done what you thought was the right thing to 
do now let me alone you lied to me mama i don't want to talk 
to you i want you to take me back to new york you have nothing 
else to do don't try to explain you haven't any explanation mrs dale's spirit fairly 
raged but it was impotent in the presence of this her daughter she could do 
nothing still more hours and at one small town suzanne decided to get off but 
both mrs dale and kinroy offered actual physical opposition they felt intensely silly and ashamed 
though for they could not break the spirit of the girl she ignored their mindstheir 
mental attitude in the most contemptuous way mrs dale cried then her face hardened then 
she pleaded her daughter merely looked loftily away at three rivers suzanne stayed in the 
car and refused to move mrs dale pleaded threatened to call aid stated that she 
would charge her with insanity it was all without avail the car was uncoupled after 
the conductor had asked mrs dale if she did not intend to leave it she 
was beside herself frantic with rage shame baffled opposition i think you are terrible she 
exclaimed to suzanne you are a little demon we will live in this car then 
we will see she knew that this could not be for the car was only 
leased for the outward trip and had to be returned the next day the car 
was pushed on to a siding i beg of you suzanne please don't make a 
mockery of us this is terrible what will people think i don't care what they 
think said suzanne but you can't stay here oh yes i can come get off 
please do we won't stay up here indefinitely i'll take you back promise me to 
stay a month and i'll give you my solemn word i'll take you back at 
the end of that time i'm getting sick of this i can't stand it do 
what you like after that only stay a month now no mama replied suzanne no 
you won't you lied to me you're lying to me now just as you did 
before i swear to you i'm not i lied that once but i was frantic 
oh suzanne please please be reasonable have some consideration i will take you back but 
wait for some clothes to arrive we can't go this way she sent kinroy for 
the station master to whom was explained the need of a carriage to take them 
to mont cecile and also for a doctorthis was mrs dale's latest thoughtto whom she 
proposed to accuse suzanne of insanity help to remove her was to be called she 
told this to suzanne who simply glared at her get the doctor mama she said 
we will see if i have to go that way but you will rue every 
step of this you will be thoroughly sorry for every silly step you have taken 
when the carriage arrived suzanne refused to get out the country driver a french habitant 
reported its presence at the car kinroy tried to soothe his sister by saying that 
he would help straighten matters out if she would only go peacefully i'll tell you 
susie if it isn't all arranged to suit you within a month and you still 
want to go back i'll send you the money i have to go back tomorrow 
or next day for ma but i'll give you my word in fact i'll persuade 
mother to bring you back in two weeks you know i never lied to you 
before i never will again please come let's go over there we can be comfortable 
anyhow mrs dale had leased the lodge from the cathcarts by phone it was all 
furnishedready to live ineven wood fires prepared for lighting in the fireplaces it had hot 
and cold water controlled by a hotwater furnace system acetylene gas a supply of staples 
in the kitchen the service to take care of it was to be called together 
by the caretaker who could be reached by phone from the depot mrs dale had 
already communicated with him by the time the carriage arrived the roads were so poor 
that the use of an automobile was impossible the station agent seeing a fat fee 
in sight was most obliging suzanne listened to kinroy but she did not believe him 
she did not believe anyone now save eugene and he was nowhere near to advise 
her still since she was without money and they were threatening to call a doctor 
she thought it might be best perhaps to go peacefully her mother was most distracted 
her face was white and thin and nervous and kinroy was apparently strained to the 
breaking point do you promise me faithfully she asked her mother who had begun her 
pleadings anew corroborating kinroy in a way that you will take me back to new 
york in two weeks if i promise to stay that long this was still within 
the date in which she had promised to go to witla and as long as 
she got back by that time she really did not care provided she could write 
to her lover it was a silly arbitrary thing for her mother to have done 
but it could be endured her mother seeing no reasonable way to obtain peace promised 
if she could only keep her there two weeks quietly perhaps that would help suzanne 
could think here under different conditions new york was so exciting out at this lodge 
all would be still there was more argument and finally suzanne agreed to enter the 
hack and they drove over toward mont cecile and the cathcarts' lodge now vacant and 
lonely which was known as whileaway chapter xviii the cathcart lodge a long twostory affair 
halfway up a fine covered mountain slope was one of those summer conveniences of the 
rich situated just near enough to the primeval wilds to give one a sense of 
the unexplored and dangerous in raw nature and yet near enough to the comforts of 
civilization as represented by the cities of quebec and montreal to make one feel secure 
in the possession of those material joys otherwise so easily interrupted it was full of 
great rooms tastefully furnished with simple summery thingswillow chairs box windowseats structural book shelves great 
open fireplaces surmounted by handsome mantels outward swinging leaded casements settees pillowstrewn rustic couches great 
fur rugs and robes and things of that character the walls were ornamented with trophies 
of the chaseantlers raw fox skins mounted loons and eagles skins of bears and other 
animals this year the cathcarts were elsewhere and the lodge was to be had by 
a woman of mrs dale's standing for the asking when they reached whileaway the caretaker 
pierre an old habitant of musty loghut origin who spoke broken english and was dressed 
in earthbrown khaki over heaven knows what combination of clothes beneath had lighted the fires 
and was bestirring himself about warming the house generally with the furnaces his wife a 
small broadskirted solidbodied woman was in the kitchen preparing something to eat there was plenty 
of meat to be had from the larder of the habitant himself to say nothing 
of flour butter and the like a girl to serve was called from the family 
of a neighboring trapper she had worked in the lodge as maid to the cathcarts 
they settled down to make themselves comfortable but the old discussion continued there was no 
cessation to it and through it all actually suzanne was having her way meanwhile eugene 
back in new york was expecting word from suzanne on thursday and none came he 
called up the house only to learn that mrs dale was out of the city 
and was not expected back soon friday came and no word and saturday he tried 
a registered letter for personal delivery only return signature demanded but it came back marked 
not there then he realized that his suspicions were correct and that suzanne had fallen 
into a trap he grew gloomy fearful impatient and nervous by turn and all at 
the same time he drummed on his desk at the office tried almost in vain 
to fix his mind on the scores of details which were ever before him wandered 
aimlessly about the streets at times thinking he was asked for his opinion on art 
plans and books and advertising and circulation propositions but he could not fix his mind 
closely on what was being said the chief has certainly got something on his mind 
which is troubling him these days said carter hayes the advertising man to the circulation 
head he's not himself i don't believe he hears what i'm telling him i've noticed 
that replied the latter they were in the reception room outside eugene's door and strolled 
arm in arm down the richly carpeted hall to the elevator there's certainly something wrong 
he ought to take a rest he's trying to do too much hayes did not 
believe eugene was trying to do too much in the last four or five months 
it had been almost impossible to get near him he came down at ten or 
tenthirty in the morning left frequently at two and three had lunch engagements which had 
nothing to do with office work and at night went into the social world to 
dinner or elsewhere where he could not be found colfax had sent for him on 
a number of occasions when he was not present and on several other occasions when 
he had called on his floor and at his office eugene was out it did 
not strike him as anything to complain ofeugene had a right to be aboutbut as 
inadvisable in the managing publisher's own interest he knew that he had a vast number 
of things to take care of it would take an exceptionally efficient man to manage 
them and not give all his time to them he would not have thought this 
if eugene had been a partner with himself as were other men in other ventures 
in which he was interested but not being so he could not help viewing him 
as an employee one who ought to give all his time to his work white 
never asked anything much save the privilege of working and was always about the place 
alert earnest at his particular duties not haughty but calm and absolutely efficient in every 
way he was never weary of consulting with colfax whereas eugene was indifferent not at 
all desirous of running to him with every little proposition but preferring to act on 
his own initiative and carrying himself constantly with very much of an air in other 
ways there were other things which were and had been militating against him by degrees 
it had come to be rumored about the office that eugene was interested in the 
blue sea or sea island development and construction company of which there was a good 
deal of talk about the city particularly in financial and social circles colfax had heard 
of the corporation he had been interested in the scheme because it promised so much 
in the way of luxury not much of the panoramic whole so beautifully depicted in 
the colored insets of a thirtytwopage literary prospectus fathered by eugene was as yet accomplished 
but there was enough to indicate that it was going to be a great thing 
already somewhat over a mile and a quarter of the great sea walk and wall 
were in place a dining and dancing pavilion had been built and one of the 
smaller hotelsall in accordance with the original architectural scheme there were a number of housessomething 
like twenty or thirty on plots one hundred and fifty by one hundred and fifty 
feet built in the most ornate fashion on ground which had formerly been wet marsh 
grown high with grass three or four islands had been filled in and the club 
house of a minor yacht club had been constructed but still the sea island development 
company had a long way to go before even a third of its total perfection 
would be in sight eugene did not know the drift of the company's financial affairs 
except in a general way he had tried to keep out of it so far 
as public notice of him was concerned though he was constantly lunching with winfield willebrand 
and others and endeavoring to direct as much attention to the wonders and prospects of 
the new resort as was possible for him to do it was an easy thing 
for him to say to one person and another whom he met that blue sea 
was rapidly becoming the most perfect thing in the way of a summer resort that 
he had ever seen and this did good so did the comments of all the 
other people who were interested in it but it did not make it anything of 
a success as yet as a matter of fact the true success of blue sea 
depended on the investment of much more than the original ten millions for which it 
had been capitalized it depended on a truly solid growth which could not be rapid 
the news which came to the united magazines corporation and eventually to colfax and white 
was that eugene was heavily interested in this venture that he was secretary or held 
some other office in connection with it and that he was giving a great deal 
of his time to its development which might better be employed in furthering the interests 
of the united magazines corporation what do you think of that asked colfax of white 
on hearing the news one morning it had come through the head of the printing 
department under white who had mentioned it to colfax in white's presence by the latter's 
directions it's just what i've been telling you all along said the latter blandly he 
isn't interested in this business any more than he is in any other he's using 
it as a steppingstone and when he's through with it goodbye now that's all right 
from his point of view every man has a right to climb up but it 
isn't so good from yours you'd be better off if you had a man who 
wanted to stay here you'd be better off really if you were handling it yourself 
you may not want to do that but with what you know now you can 
get someone who will work under you quite well that's the one satisfactory thing about 
ityou really can get along without him if it comes right down to it now 
with a good man in there it can be handled from your office it was 
about this time that the most ardent phase of eugene's love affair with suzanne began 
all through the spring and summer eugene had been busy with thoughts of suzanne ways 
of meeting her pleasurable rides with her thinking of things she had done and said 
as a rule now his thoughts were very far from the interests of his position 
and in the main it bored him greatly he began to wish earnestly that his 
investment in the sea island corporation would show some tangible return in the way of 
interest so that he could have means to turn round with it struck him after 
angela's discovery of his intrigue with suzanne as a most unfortunate thing that he had 
tied up all his means in this blue sea investment if it had been fated 
that he was to go on living with angela it would have been all right 
then he could have waited in patience and thought nothing of it now it simply 
meant that if he wanted to realize it it would all be tied up in 
the courts or most likely so for angela could sue him and at any rate 
he would wish to make reasonable provision for her and that would require legal adjustment 
apart from this investment he had nothing now save his salary and that was not 
accumulating fast enough to do him much good in case mrs dale went to colfax 
soon and the latter broke with him he wondered if colfax really would break with 
him would he ask him to give up suzanne or simply force him to resign 
he had noticed that for some time colfax had not been as cordial to and 
as enthusiastic about him as he had formerly been but this might be due to 
other things besides opposition moreover it was natural for them to become a little tired 
of each other they did not go about so much together and when they did 
colfax was not as highflown and boyish in his spirits as he had formerly been 
eugene fancied it was white who was caballing against him but he thought if colfax 
was going to change he was going to change and there was no help for 
it there were no grounds he fancied in so far as the affairs of the 
corporation were concerned his work was successful the storm broke one day out of a 
clear sky in so far as the office was concerned but not until there had 
been much heartache and misery in various directionswith the dales with angela and with eugene 
himself suzanne's action was the lightning bolt which precipitated the storm it could only come 
from that quarter eugene was frantic to hear from her and for the first time 
in his life began to experience those excruciating and gnawing pangs which are the concomitants 
of uncertain and distraught love it manifested itself in an actual pain in his vitalsin 
the region of the solar plexus or what is commonly known as the pit of 
the stomach he suffered there very much quite as the spartan boy may have done 
who was gnawed by the fox concealed under his belt he would wonder where suzanne 
was what she was doing and then being unable to work would call his car 
and ride or take his hat and walk it did him no good to ride 
for the agony was in sitting still at night he would go home and sit 
by one or the other of his studio windows principally out on the little stone 
balcony and watch the changing panorama of the hudson yearning and wondering where she was 
would he ever see her again would he be able to win this battle if 
he did oh her beautiful face her lovely voice her exquisite lips and eyes the 
marvel of her touch and beautiful fancy he tried to compose poetry to her and 
wrote a series of sonnets to his beloved which were not at all bad he 
worked on his sketch book of pencil portraits of suzanne seeking a hundred significant and 
delightful expressions and positions which could afterwards be elaborated into his gallery of paintings of 
her which he proposed to paint at some time it did not matter to him 
that angela was about though he had the graciousness to conceal these things from her 
he was ashamed in a way of his treatment of her and yet the sight 
of her now was not so much pitiable as objectionable and unsatisfactory why had he 
married her he kept asking himself that they sat in the studio one night angela's 
face was a picture of despair for the horror of her situation was only by 
degrees coming to her and she said seeing him so moody and despondent: eugene don't 
you think you can get over this you say suzanne has been spirited away why 
not let her go think of your career eugene think of me what will become 
of me you can get over it if you try surely you won't throw me 
down after all the years i have been with you think how i have tried 
i have been a pretty good wife to you haven't i i haven't annoyed you 
so terribly much have i oh i feel all the time as though we were 
on the brink of some terrible catastrophe if only i could do something if only 
i could say something i know i have been hard and irritable at times but 
that is all over now i am a changed woman i would never be that 
way any more it can't be done angela he replied calmly it can't be done 
i don't love you i've told you that i don't want to live with you 
i can't i want to get free in some way either by divorce or a 
quiet separation and go my way i'm not happy i never will be as long 
as i am here i want my freedom and then i will decide what i 
want to do angela shook her head and sighed she could scarcely believe that this 
was she wandering around in her own apartment wondering what she was going to do 
in connection with her own husband marietta had gone back to wisconsin before the storm 
broke myrtle was in new york but she hated to confess to her she did 
not dare to write to any member of her own family but marietta and she 
did not want to confess to her marietta had fancied while she was here that 
they were getting along nicely she had fits of crying which alternated with fits of 
anger but the latter were growing weak fear despondency and grief were becoming uppermost in 
her soul againthe fear and despondency that had weighed her down in those lonely days 
before she married eugene the grief that she was now actually and finally to lose 
the one man whom in spite of everything she loved still chapter xix it was 
three days later when he was at his office that a telegram came from mrs 
dale which read i depend on you on the honor of a gentleman to ignore 
any message which may come from my daughter until i see you eugene was puzzled 
but fancied that there must be a desperate quarrel on between suzanne and her mother 
wherever they were and that it was probable that he would hear from her now 
it was his first inkling as to her whereabouts for the telegram was sent off 
from three rivers in canada and he fancied they must be near there somewhere the 
place of despatch did him no good from a material point of view for he 
could neither write nor pursue suzanne on the strength of this he would not know 
where to find her he could only wait conscious that she was having a struggle 
perhaps as severe or possibly more so than his own he wandered about with this 
telegram in his pocket wondering when he should hearwhat a day should bring forth and 
all those who came in contact with him noticed that there was something wrong colfax 
saw him and asked: what's the matter old man you're not looking as chipper as 
you might he fancied it might be something in connection with the blue sea corporation 
he had heard after he had learned that eugene was in it that it would 
take much more money than had been invested to date to make it a really 
successful seaside proposition according to the original outlines and that it would be years before 
it could possibly yield an adequate return if eugene had put much money in it 
he had probably lost it or tied it up in a most unsatisfactory way well 
it served him right for trifling with things he knew nothing about oh nothing replied 
eugene abstractedly i'm all right i'm just a little run down physically i'll come round 
you'd better take a month or so off and brace up if you're not in 
shape oh not at all not now anyhow it occurred to eugene that he might 
use the time to advantage a little later and that he would claim it they 
proceeded to business but colfax noticed that eugene's eyes were specially hollow and weary and 
that he was noticeably restless he wondered whether he might be going to break down 
physically suzanne had drifted along peacefully enough considering the nature of the feeling between her 
and her mother at this time after a few days of desultory discussion however along 
the lines now so familiar she began to see that her mother had no intention 
of terminating their stay at the time agreed upon particularly since their return to new 
york meant so far as suzanne was concerned her immediate departure to witla mrs dale 
began at first to plead for additional delay and later that suzanne should agree not 
to go to new york but to lenox for a season it was cold up 
here already now though there were still spells of bright warm summery or autumn weather 
between ten and four in the day and sometimes in the evening the nights usually 
were cold mrs dale would gladly have welcomed a compromise for it was terribly lonely 
just herself and suzanneafter the gaieties of new york four days before the time of 
her proposed departure mrs dale was still obdurate or parleying in a diplomatic way and 
suzanne disgusted made the threat which caused mrs dale to wire distractedly to eugene later 
she composed the following which she gave to gabrielle: dear eugene if you love me 
come and get me i have told mama that if she did not keep her 
word to return with me to new york by the fifteenth i would write to 
you and she is still obstinate i am at the cathcart lodge whileaway eighteen miles 
north of three rivers here in canada anyone can show you i will be here 
when you come do not try to write to me as i am afraid i 
should not get it but i will be at the lodge with love suzanne eugene 
had never before received a love appeal nor indeed any such appeal from any woman 
in his life this letter reached him thirtysix hours after the telegram arrived and set 
him to planning at once the hour had struck he must act perhaps this old 
world was now behind him forever could he really get suzanne if he went to 
canada to find her how was she surrounded he thrilled with delight when he realized 
that it was suzanne who was calling him and that he was going to find 
her if you love me come and get me would he watch he called for 
his car telephoned his valet to pack his bag and bring it to the grand 
central station first ascertaining for himself the time of departure asked to talk to angela 
who had gone to myrtle's apartment in upper seventh avenue ready at last to confess 
her woes to eugene's sister her condition did not appeal to eugene in this situation 
the inevitable result which he thought of frequently was still far away he notified colfax 
that he was going to take a few days rest went to the bank where 
he had over four thousand dollars on deposit and drew it all he then went 
to a ticket office and purchased a oneway ticket uncertain where his actions would take 
him once he saw suzanne he tried once more to get angela intending boldly to 
tell her that he was going to seek suzanne and to tell her not to 
worry that he would communicate with her but she had not returned curiously through all 
this he was intensely sorry for her and wondered how she would take it if 
he did not return how would the child be arranged for he felt he must 
go angela was heartsick he knew that and frightened still he could not resist this 
call he could not resist anything in connection with this love affair he was like 
a man possessed of a devil or wandering in a dream he knew that his 
whole career was at stake but it did not make any difference he must get 
her the whole world could go hang if he could only obtain herher the beautiful 
the perfect at fivethirty the train departed and then he sat as it rolled northward 
speculating on what he was to do when he got there if three rivers were 
much of a place he could probably hire an automobile he could leave it some 
distance from the lodge and then see if he could not approach unobserved and signal 
suzanne if she were about she would no doubt be on the lookout at a 
sign she would run to him they would hurry to the automobile the pursuit might 
quickly follow but he would arrange it so that his pursuers would not know which 
railroad station he was going to quebec was the nearest big city he found by 
studying the map though he might return to montreal and new york or buffalo if 
he chose to go west he would see how the train ran it is curious 
what vagaries the human mind is subject to under conditions of this kind up to 
the time of eugene's arrival in three rivers and after he had no plan of 
campaign or of future conduct beyond that of obtaining suzanne he did not know that 
he would return to new yorkhe did not know that he would not if suzanne 
wished and it were best and they could they would go to england from montreal 
or france if necessary they could go to portland and sail mrs dale on the 
evidence that he had suzanne and that of her own free will and volition might 
yield and say nothing in which case he could return to new york and resume 
his position this courageous stand on his part if he had only followed it might 
have solved the whole problem quickly it might have been the sword that would have 
cut the gordian knot on the train was a heavy blackbearded man which was always 
good luck to him at three rivers when he dismounted from the train he found 
a horseshoe which was also a lucky sign he did not stop to think what 
he would do if he really lost his position and had to live on the 
sum he had with him he was really not thinking logically he was dreaming he 
fancied that he would get suzanne and have his salary and that somehow things would 
be much as they were of such is the logic of dreams when he arrived 
at three rivers of course the conditions were not what he anticipated it is true 
that at times after a long continued period of dry weather the roads were passable 
for automobiles at least as far as whileaway but the weather had not recently been 
entirely dry there had been a short period of cold rain and the roads were 
practically impassable save for horses and carryalls there was a carryall which went as far 
as st jacques four miles from whileaway where the driver told him he could get 
a horse if he wanted one the owner of this hack line had a stable 
there this was gratifying to him and he decided to make arrangements for two horses 
at st jacques which he would take to within a reasonable distance of the lodge 
and tie in some spot where they would not be seen then he could consider 
the situation and signal suzanne if she were there on the lookout how dramatic the 
end would be how happy they would be flying together judge then his astonishment on 
reaching st jacques to find mrs dale waiting for him word had been telephoned by 
her faithful representative the station agent at three rivers that a man of eugene's description 
had arrived and departed for whileaway before this a telegram had come from new york 
from kinroy to the effect that eugene had gone somewhere his daily habits since mrs 
dale had gone away had been under observation kinroy on his return had called at 
the united magazines corporation and asked if eugene was in the city heretofore he had 
been reported in when on this day he was reported as having gone kinroy called 
up angela to inquire she also stated that he had left the city he then 
wired his mother and she calculating the time of his arrival and hearing from the 
station agent of his taking the carryall had gone down to meet him she had 
decided to fight every inch of the way with all the strategy at her command 
she did not want to kill himhad not really the courage to do thatbut she 
still hoped to dissuade him she had not been able to bring herself to resort 
to guards and detectives as yet he could not be as hard as he looked 
and acted suzanne was bedeviling him by her support and communications she had not been 
able to govern there she saw her only hope was to talk him out of 
it or into an additional delay if necessary they would all go back to new 
york together and she would appeal to colfax and winfield she hoped they would persuade 
him to reason anyhow she would never leave suzanne for one moment until this thing 
had been settled in her favor or brutally against her when eugene appeared she greeted 
him with her old social smile and called to him affably: come get in he 
looked at her grimly and obeyed but changed his manner when he saw that she 
was really kindly in her tone and greeted her sociably how have you been he 
asked oh quite well thank you and how is suzanne all right i fancy she 
isn't here you know where is she asked eugene his face a study in defeat 
she went with some friends to visit quebec for ten days then she is going 
from there to new york i don't expect to see her here any more eugene 
choked with a sense of repugnance to her airy taradiddles he did not believe what 
she was sayingsaw at once that she was fencing with him that's a lie he 
said roughly and it's out of the whole cloth she's here and you know it 
anyhow i am going to see for myself how polite you are she laughed diplomatically 
that isn't the way you usually talk anyhow she isn't here you'll find that out 
if you insist i wouldn't advise you to insist for i've sent for counsel since 
i heard you were coming and you will find detectives as well as guards waiting 
to receive you she isn't here though even at that and you might just as 
well turn round and go back i will drive you over to three rivers if 
you wish why not be reasonable now and avoid a scene she isn't here you 
couldn't have her if she were the people i have employed will prevent that if 
you make trouble you will simply be arrested and then the newspapers will have it 
why not be reasonable now mr witla and go on back you have everything to 
lose there is a train through three rivers from quebec for new york at eleven 
tonight we can make it don't you want to do that i will agree if 
you come to your senses now and cause me no trouble here to bring suzanne 
back to new york within a month i won't let you have her unless you 
get a divorce and straighten things out with your wife but if you can do 
that within six months or a year and she still wants you you can have 
her i will promise in writing to withdraw all objection and see that her full 
share of her property comes to her uncontested i will help you and her socially 
all i can you know i am not without influence i want to see her 
first replied eugene grimly and disbelievingly i won't say that i will forget everything went 
on mrs dale ignoring his interpolated remark i can'tbut i will pretend to you can 
have the use of my country place at lenox i will buy out the lease 
at morristown or the new york house and you can live in either place i 
will set aside a sum of money for your wife if you wish that may 
help you obtain your release surely you do not want to take her under the 
illegal condition which you propose when you can have her outright in this brilliant manner 
by waiting a little while she says she does not want to get married but 
that is silly talk based on nothing except erratic reading she does or she will 
the moment she comes to think about it seriously why not help her why not 
go back now and let me bring her to new york a little later and 
then we will talk this all over i shall be very glad to have you 
in my family you are a brilliant man i have always liked you why not 
be reasonable come now and let's drive over to three rivers and you take the 
train back to new york will you while mrs dale had been talking eugene had 
been surveying her calmly what a clever talker she was how she could lie he 
did not believe her he did not believe one word that she said she was 
fighting to keep him from suzanne why he could readily understand suzanne was somewhere here 
he fancied though as in the case of her recent trip to albany she might 
have been spirited away absurd said eugene easily defiantly indifferently i'll not do anything of 
the sort in the first place i don't believe you if you are so anxious 
to be nice to me let me see her and then you can say all 
this in front of her i've come up here to see her and i'm going 
to she's here i know she is you needn't lie you needn't talk i know 
she's here now i'm going to see her if i have to stay here a 
month and search mrs dale stirred nervously she knew that eugene was desperate she knew 
that suzanne had written to him talk might be useless strategy might not avail but 
she could not help using it listen to me she said excitedly i tell you 
suzanne is not here she's gone there are guards up therelots of them they know 
who you are they have your description they have orders to kill you if you 
try to break in kinroy is there he is desperate i have been having a 
struggle to prevent his killing you already the place is watched we are watched at 
this moment won't you be reasonable you can't see her she's gone why make all 
this fuss why take your life in your hands don't talk said eugene you're lying 
i can see it in your face besides my life is nothing i am not 
afraid why talk she's here i'm going to see her he stared before him and 
mrs dale ruminated as to what she was to do there were no guards or 
detectives as she said kinroy was not there suzanne was not away this was all 
palaver as eugene suspected for she was too anxious to avoid publicity to give any 
grounds for it before she was absolutely driven it was a rather halcyon evening after 
some days of exceeding chill a bright moon was coming up in the east already 
discernible in the twilight but which later would shine brilliantly it was not cold but 
really pleasantly warm and the rough road along which they were driving was richly odorous 
eugene was not unconscious of its beauty but depressed by the possibility of suzanne's absence 
oh do be generous pleaded mrs dale who feared that once they saw each other 
reason would disappear suzanne would demand as she had been continually demanding to be taken 
back to new york eugene with or without suzanne's consent or plea would ignore her 
overtures of compromise and there would be immediate departure or defiant union here she thought 
she would kill them if need be but in the face of eugene's defiant persistence 
on one side and suzanne's on the other her courage was failing she was frightened 
by the daring of this man i will keep my word she observed distractedly honestly 
she isn't here she's in quebec i tell you wait a month i will bring 
her back then we will arrange things together why can't you be generous i could 
be said eugene who was considering all the brilliant prospects which her proposal involved and 
being moved by them but i can't believe you you're not telling me the truth 
you didn't tell the truth to suzanne when you took her from new york that 
was a trick and this is another i know she isn't away she's right up 
there in the lodge wherever it is you take me to her and then we 
will talk this thing out together by the way where are you going mrs dale 
had turned into a bypath or halfformed road closely lined with small trees and looking 
as though it might be a woodchoppers' path to the lodge i don't believe it 
replied eugene who was intensely suspicious this isn't a main road to any such place 
as that i tell you it is mrs dale was nearing the precincts of the 
lodge and wanted more time to talk and plead well said eugene you can go 
this way if you want to i'm going to get out and walk you can't 
throw me off by driving me around in some general way i'm going to stay 
here a week a month two months if necessary but i'm not going back without 
seeing suzanne she's here and i know it i'll go up alone and find her 
i'm not afraid of your guards he jumped out and mrs dale gave up in 
despair wait she pleaded it's over two miles yet i'll take you there she isn't 
home tonight anyhow she's over at the cottage of the caretaker oh why won't you 
be reasonable i'll bring her to new york i tell you are you going to 
throw aside all those fine prospects and wreck your life and hers and mine oh 
if mr dale were only alive if i had a man on whom i could 
rely come get in and i'll drive you up there but promise me you won't 
ask to see her tonight she isn't there anyway she's over at the caretaker's oh 
dear if only something would happen to solve this i thought you said she was 
in quebec i only said that to gain time i'm so unstrung it wasn't true 
but she isn't at the lodge truly she's away tonight i can't let you stay 
there let me take you back to st jacques and you can stay with old 
pierre gaine you can come up in the morning the servants will think it so 
strange i promise you you shall see suzanne i give you my word your word 
why mrs dale you're going around in a ring i can't believe anything you say 
replied eugene calmly he was very much collected and elated now since he knew that 
suzanne was here he was going to see herhe felt it he had mrs dale 
badly worsted and he proposed to drive her until in the presence of suzanne he 
and his beloved dictated terms i'm going there tonight and you are going to bring 
her to me if she isn't there you know where to find her she's here 
and i'm going to see her tonight we'll talk of all this you're proposing in 
front of her it's silly to twist things around this way the girl is with 
me and you know it she's mine you can't control her now we two will 
talk to you together he sat back in the light vehicle and began to hum 
a tune the moon was getting clearer promise me just one thing urged mrs dale 
despairingly promise me that you will urge suzanne to accept my proposition a few months 
won't hurt you can see her in new york as usual go about getting a 
divorce you are the only one who has any influence with her i admit it 
she won't believe me she won't listen to me you tell her your future is 
in it persuade her to wait persuade her to stay up here or at lenox 
for a little while and then come down she will obey you she will believe 
anything you say i have lied i have lied terribly all through this but you 
can't blame me put yourself in my place think of my position please use your 
influence i will do all that i say and more will you bring suzanne to 
me tonight yes if you promise will you bring her to me tonight promise or 
no promise i don't want to say anything to you which i can't say in 
front of her won't you promise me that you will accept my proposition and urge 
her to i think i will but i won't say i want her to hear 
what you have to say i think i will mrs dale shook her head despondently 
you might as well acquiesce went on eugene i'm going to see her anyhow whether 
you will or no she's there and i'll find her if i have to search 
the house room by room she can hear my voice he was carrying things with 
a high hand well replied mrs dale i suppose i must please don't let on 
to the servants pretend you're my guest let me take you back to st jacques 
tonight after you see her don't stay with her more than half an hour she 
was absolutely frightened out of her wits at this terrific dénouement eugene sat grimly congratulating 
himself as they jogged on in the moonlight he actually squeezed her arm cheerfully and 
told her not to be so despairingthat all would come out all right they would 
talk to suzanne he would see what she would have to say you stay here 
she said as they reached a little wooded knoll in a bend of the roada 
high spot commanding a vast stretch of territory now lit by a glistening northern moon 
i'll go right inside and get her i don't know whether she's there but if 
she isn't she's over at the caretaker's and we'll go over there i don't want 
the servants to see you meet her please don't be demonstrative oh be careful eugene 
smiled how excited she was how pointless after all her threats so this was victory 
what a fight he had made here he was outside this beautiful lodge the lights 
of which he could see gleaming like yellow gold through the silvery shadows the air 
was full of field fragrances you could smell the dewy earth soon to be hard 
and covered deep in snow there was still a bird's voice here and there and 
faint stirrings of the wind in the leaves on such a night came back shakespeare's 
lines how fitting that suzanne should come to him under such conditions oh the wonder 
of this romancethe beauty of it from the very beginning it had been set about 
with perfections of scenery and material environment obviously nature had intended this as the crowning 
event of his life life recognized him as a geniusthe fates it was heaping posies 
in his lap laying a crown of victory upon his brow he waited while mrs 
dale went to the lodge and then after a time true enough there appeared in 
the distance the swinging buoyant girlish form of suzanne she was plump healthful vigorous he 
could detect her in the shadows under the trees and behind her a little way 
mrs dale suzanne came eagerly onyouthful buoyant dancing determined beautiful her skirts were swinging about 
her body in ripples as she strode she looked all eugene had ever thought her 
hebea young diana a venus at nineteen her lips were parted in a welcoming smile 
as she drew near and her eyes were as placid as those dull opals which 
still burn with a hidden lustre of gold and flame she held out her arms 
to him as she came running the last few steps suzanne called her mother for 
shame hush mama declared suzanne defiantly i don't care i don't care it's your fault 
you shouldn't have lied to me he wouldn't have come if i hadn't sent for 
him i'm going back to new york i told you i was she did not 
say oh eugene as she came close but gathered his face in her hands and 
looked eagerly into his eyes his burned into hers she stepped back and opened wide 
her arms only to fold them tightly about him at last at last he said 
kissing her feverishly oh suzanne oh flower face i knew you would come she said 
i told her you would i'll go back with you yes yes said eugene oh 
this wonderful night this wonderful climax oh to have you in my arms again mrs 
dale stood by white intense to think a daughter of hers should act like this 
confound her so make her a helpless spectator of her iniquity what an astounding terrible 
impossible thing suzanne she cried oh that i should have lived to see this day 
i told you mama that you would regret bringing me up here declared suzanne i 
told you i would write to him i knew you would come she said to 
eugene and she squeezed his hand affectionately eugene inhaled a deep breath and stared at 
her the night the stars swung around him in a gorgeous orbit thus it was 
to be victorious it was too beautiful too wonderful to think he should have triumphed 
in this way could any other man anywhere ever have enjoyed such a victory oh 
suzanne he said eagerly this is like a dream it's like heaven i can scarcely 
believe i am alive yes yes she replied it is beautiful perfect and together they 
strolled away from her mother hand in hand chapter xx the flaw in this situation 
was that eugene after getting suzanne in his arms once more had no particular solution 
to offer instead of at once outlining an open or secret scheme of escape or 
taking her by main force and walking off with her as she more than half 
expected him to do here he was repeating to her what her mother had told 
him and instead of saying come he was asking her advice this is what your 
mother proposed to me just now suzanne he began and entered upon a full explanation 
it was a vision of empire to him i said to her he said speaking 
of her mother who was near by that i would decide nothing she wanted me 
to say that i would do this but i insisted that it must be left 
to you if you want to go back to new york we will go tonight 
or tomorrow if you want to accept this plan of your mother's it's all right 
so far as i am concerned i would rather have you now but if i 
can see you i am willing to wait he was calm now logical foolishly speculative 
suzanne wondered at this she had no advice to offer she had expected some dramatic 
climax but since it had not come about she had to be content the truth 
was that she had been swept along by her desire to be with eugene it 
had seemed to her in the beginning that it was not possible for him to 
get a divorce it had seemed also from her reading and youthful philosophizing that it 
was really not necessary she did not want to be mean to angela she did 
not want eugene to mortify her by openly leaving her she had fancied since eugene 
had said that angela was not satisfactory to him and that there was no real 
love between them that angela really did not care she had practically admitted as much 
in her letterthat it would not make so much difference if she shared him with 
her what was he explaining nowa new theory as to what they were to do 
she thought he was coming for her to take her away like a god whereas 
here he was presenting a new theory to her in anything but a godlike way 
it was confusing she did not know how it was that eugene did not want 
to leave at once well i don't know whatever you think she said if you 
want me to stay here another month no no exclaimed eugene quickly conscious of a 
flaw in the arrangement and anxious to make it seem right i didn't mean that 
not that i want you to come back with me now if possible tonight only 
i wanted to tell you this your mother seems sincere it seems a shame if 
we can keep friends with her and still have our way not to do so 
i don't want to do any greater harm than i can help unless you are 
perfectly willing and he hesitated over his own thoughts at this moment suzanne could scarcely 
have told what she felt the crux of the situation was being put to her 
for her decision and it should not be she was not strong enough not experienced 
enough eugene should decide and whatever he decided would be right the truth was that 
after getting her in his arms again and that in the presence of her mother 
eugene did not feel that he was quite so much the victor as he had 
imagined or that the whole problem of his life was solved he could not very 
well ignore he thought what mrs dale had to offer if she was offering it 
seriously she had said to him just before he came into the presence of suzanne 
that unless he accepted these terms she would go on fightingthat she would telegraph to 
colfax and ask him to come up here although eugene had drawn his money and 
was ready to fly if he could still the thought of colfax and the desire 
to keep his present state of social security and gain all mrs dale had to 
offer besides were deterrents he hesitated wasn't there some way to smooth everything out i 
don't want you to decide finally he said but what do you think suzanne was 
in a simmering nebulous state and could not think eugene was here this was arcady 
and the moon was high it was beautiful to have him with her again it 
was wonderful to feel his caresses but he was not flying with her they were 
not defying the world they were not doing what she fancied they would be doing 
rushing to victory and that was what she had sent for him for mrs dale 
was going to help eugene get a divorce so she said she was going to 
help subsidize angela if necessary suzanne was going to get married and actually settle down 
after a time what a curious thought why that was not what she had wanted 
to do she had wanted to flout convention in some way to do original things 
as she had planned as she had dreamed it might be disastrous but she did 
not think so her mother would have yielded why was eugene compromising it was curious 
such thoughts as these formulated in her mind at this time were the most disastrous 
things that could happen to their romance union should have followed his presence flight should 
have been a portion of it as it was she was in his arms but 
she was turning over vague nebulous thoughts somethinga pale mist before an otherwise brilliant moon 
a bit of spindrift a speck of cloud no bigger than a man's hand that 
might possibly portend something and might not had come over the situation eugene was as 
desirable as ever but he was not flying with her they were talking about going 
back to new york afterwards but they were not going together at once how was 
that do you think mama can really damage you with mr colfax she asked curiously 
at one point after eugene had mentioned her mother's threat i don't know he replied 
solemnly yes i think she could i don't know what he'd do though it doesn't 
matter much one way or the other he added suzanne puzzled well if you want 
to wait it's all right she said i want to do whatever you think best 
i don't want you to lose your position if you think we ought to wait 
we will not if i'm not to be with you regularly replied eugene who was 
wavering he was not your true champion of victoryyour administrative leader foolishly he was spelling 
over an arrangement whereby he could eat his cake and have itsee suzanne drive with 
her dance with her all but live with her in new york until such time 
as the actual union could be arranged secretly or openly mrs dale was promising to 
receive him as a son but she was merely plotting for timetime to think act 
permit suzanne under argument to come to her senses time would solve everything she thought 
and tonight as she hung about keeping close and overhearing some of eugene's remarks she 
felt relieved either he was coming to his senses and beginning to regret his folly 
or he was being deluded by her lies if she could keep him and suzanne 
apart one more week and get to new york herself she would go to colfax 
now and to winfield and see if they could not be induced to use their 
good offices eugene must be broken he was erratic insane her lies were apparently plausible 
enough to gain her this delay and that was all she wanted well i don't 
know whatever you think said suzanne again after a time between embraces and kisses do 
you want me to come back with you tomorrow or yes yes he replied quickly 
and vigorously tomorrow only we must try and argue your mother into the right frame 
of mind she feels that she has lost now since we are together and we 
must keep her in that mind she talks compromise and that's just what we want 
if she is willing to have us make some arrangement why not i would be 
willing to let things rest for a week or so just to give her a 
chance if she wishes if she doesn't change then we can act you could come 
as far as lenox for a week and then come on he talked like one 
who had won a great victory whereas he had really suffered a great defeat he 
was not taking suzanne suzanne brooded it was not what she expectedbut yes she said 
after a time will you return with me tomorrow yes as far as lenox or 
new york we'll see what mama says if you can agree with heranything you wanti 
am willing after a time eugene and suzanne parted for the night it was agreed 
that they should see each other in the morning that they should go back as 
far as lenox together mrs dale was to help eugene get a divorce it was 
a delightfully affectionate and satisfactory situation but somehow eugene felt that he was not handling 
it right he went to bed in one part of the housesuzanne in anothermrs dale 
fearful and watchful staying near by but there was no need he was not desperate 
he went to sleep thinking that the near future was going to adjust everything for 
him nicely and that he and suzanne were eventually going to get married chapter xxi 
the next day after wavering whether they would not spend a few days here in 
billing and cooing and listening to mrs dale's veiled pleas as to what the servants 
might think or what they might know already or suspect from what the station master 
at three rivers might say they decided to return eugene to new york suzanne to 
lenox all the way back to albany eugene and suzanne sat together in one seat 
in the pullman like two children rejoicing in each other's company mrs dale sat one 
seat away turning over her promises and pondering whether after all she had not yet 
better go at once and try to end all by an appeal to colfax or 
whether she had better wait a little while and see if the affair might not 
die down of its own accord at albany the following morning suzanne and mrs dale 
transferred to the boston and albany eugene going on to new york he went to 
the office feeling much relieved and later in the day to his apartment angela who 
had been under a terrific strain stared at him as if he were a ghost 
or one come back to life from the dead she had not known where he 
had gone she had not known whether he would ever come back there was no 
use in reproaching himshe had realized that long since the best she could do was 
to make an appeal she waited until after dinner at which they had discussed the 
mere commonplaces of life and then came to his room where he was unpacking did 
you go to find suzanne she asked yes is she with you no oh eugene 
do you know where i have spent the last three days she asked he did 
not answer on my knees on my knees she declared asking god to save you 
from yourself don't talk rot angela he returned coldly you know how i feel about 
this thing how much worse am i now than i was before i tried to 
get you on the phone to tell you i went to find her and bring 
her back and i did as far as lenox i am going to win this 
fight i am going to get suzanne either legally or otherwise if you want to 
give me a divorce you can i will provide amply for you if you don't 
i'm going to take her anyhow that's understood between me and her now what's the 
use of hysterics angela looked at him tearfully could this be the eugene she had 
known in each scene with him after each plea or through it she came to 
this adamantine wall was he really so frantic about this girl was he going to 
do what he said he outlined to her quite calmly his plans as recently revised 
and at one point angela speaking of mrs dale interrupted himshe will never give her 
up to youyou will see you think she will she says she will she is 
only fooling you she is fighting for time think what you are doing you can't 
win oh yes i can said eugene i practically have already she will come to 
me she may she may but at what a cost look at me eugene am 
i not enough i am still good looking you have declared to me time and 
again that i have a beautiful form see seeshe tore open her dressing gown and 
the robe de nuit in which she had come in she had arranged this scene 
especially thought it out and hoped it would move him am i not enough am 
i not still all that you desire eugene turned his head away in disgustwearilysick of 
their melodramatic appeals this was the last rôle angela should have played it was the 
most ineffectual the least appropriate at the moment it was dramatic striking but totally ineffective 
under the circumstances it's useless acting in that way to me angela he said i'm 
no longer to be moved in that way by you all marital affection between us 
is deadterribly so why plead to me with something that has no appeal i can't 
help it it's dead now what are we going to do about it once more 
angela turned wearily although she was nerve worn and despairing she was still fascinated by 
the tragedy which was being played out under her eyes would nothing make him see 
they went their separate ways for the night and the next day he was at 
his desk again word came from suzanne that she was still in lenox and then 
that her mother had gone to boston for a day or two on a visit 
the fifth day colfax stepped into his office and hailing him pleasantly sat down well 
how are things with you old man he asked oh about the same said eugene 
i can't complain everything going all right with you yes moderately so people don't usually 
butt in on you here when i'm here do they he asked curiously i've given 
orders against anything like that but i'll make it doubly sure in this case said 
eugene alert at once could colfax be going to talk to him about anything in 
connection with his case he paled a little colfax looked out of the window at 
the distant panorama of the hudson he took out a cigar and cut the end 
but did not light it i asked you about not being interrupted he began thoughtfully 
because i have a little something i want to talk to you about which i 
would rather no one else heard mrs dale came to me the other day he 
said quietly eugene started at the mention of her name and paled still more but 
gave no other outward sign and she told me a long story about something that 
you were trying to do in connection with her daughterrun away with her or go 
and live with her without a license or a divorce or desert your wife or 
something to that effect which i didn't pay much attention to but which i have 
to talk to you about just the same now i never like to meddle with 
a man's personal affairs i don't think that they concern me i don't think they 
concern this business except in so far as they may affect it unfavorably but i 
would like to know if it is true is it yes said eugene mrs dale 
is an old friend of mine i've known her for years i know mrs witla 
of course but not quite in the same way i haven't seen as much of 
her as i have of you i didn't know that you were unhappily married but 
that is neither here nor there the point is that she seems to be on 
the verge of making a great scandal out of thisshe seems a little distracted to 
meand i thought i'd better come up and have a little talk with you before 
anything serious really happened you know it would be a rather damaging thing to this 
business if any scandal were started in connection with you just at present he paused 
expecting some protest or explanation but eugene merely held his peace he was tense pale 
harried so she had gone to colfax after all instead of going to boston instead 
of keeping her word she had come down here to new york and gone to 
colfax had she told him the full story very likely colfax in spite of all 
his smooth words would be inclined to sympathize with her what must he think of 
him he was rather conservative in a social way mrs dale could be of service 
to him in her world in one way and another he had never seen colfax 
quite so cool and deliberate as he was now he seemed to be trying to 
maintain an exceedingly judicial and impartial tone which was not characteristic you have always been 
an interesting study to me witla ever since i first met you he went on 
after a time you're a genius i fancy if there ever was one but like 
all geniuses you are afflicted with tendencies which are erratic i used to think for 
a little while that maybe you sat down and planned the things which you have 
carried through so successfully but i have since concluded that you don't you attract some 
forms of force and order also i think you have various other facultiesit would be 
hard for me to say just what they are one is vision i know you 
have that another is appreciation of ability i know you have that i have seen 
you pick some exceptional people you plan in a way but you don't plan logically 
or deliberately unless i am greatly mistaken the matter of this dale girl now is 
an interesting case in point i think let's not talk of her said eugene frigidly 
and bridling slightly suzanne was a sore point with him a dangerous subject colfax saw 
it that's something i can't talk about very well well we won't put in the 
other calmly but the point can be established in other ways you'll admit i think 
that you haven't been planning very well in connection with this present situation for if 
you had been you would see that in doing what you have been doing you 
have been riding straight for a fall if you were going to take the girl 
and she was willing as she appears to be you should have taken her without 
her mother's knowledge old man she might have been able to adjust things afterward if 
not you would have had her and i suppose you would have been willing to 
suffer the consequences if you had been caught as it is you have let mrs 
dale in on it and she has powerful friends you can't ignore her i can't 
she is in a fighting mood and it looks as though she were going to 
bring considerable pressure to bear to make you let go he paused again waiting to 
see if eugene would say something but the latter made no comment i want to 
ask one question and i don't want you to take any offense at it for 
i don't mean anything by it but it will help to clear this matter up 
in my own mind and probably in yours later if you will have you had 
anything to do in a compromising way with miss no said eugene before he could 
finish how long has this fight been going on oh about four weeks or a 
little less colfax bit at the end of his cigar you have powerful enemies here 
you know witla your rule hasn't been very lenient one of the things i have 
noticed about you is your utter inability to play politics you have picked men who 
would be very glad to have your shoes if they could if they could get 
the details of this predicament your situation wouldn't be tenable more than fifteen minutes you 
know that of course in spite of anything i might do you would have to 
resign you couldn't maintain yourself here i couldn't let you you haven't thought of that 
in this connection i suppose no man in love does i know just how you 
feel from having seen mrs witla i can tell in a way just what the 
trouble is you have been reined in too close you haven't been master in your 
own home it's irritated you life has appeared to be a failure you have lost 
your chance or thought you had on this matrimonial game and it's made you restless 
i know this girl she's beautiful but just as i say old man you haven't 
counted the costyou haven't calculated rightyou haven't planned if anything could prove to me what 
i have always faintly suspected about you it is this: you don't plan carefully enough 
and he looked out of the window eugene sat staring at the floor he couldn't 
make out just what it was that colfax intended to do about it he was 
calmer in his thinking than he had ever seen him beforeless dramatic as a rule 
colfax yelled thingsdemonstrated performedmade excited motions this morning he was slow thoughtful possibly emotional in 
spite of the fact that i like you personally witlaand every man owes a little 
something to friendshipit can't be worked out in business thoughi have been slowly coming to 
the conclusion that perhaps after all you aren't just the ideal man for this place 
you're too emotional i fancytoo erratic white has been trying to tell me that for 
a long time but i wouldn't believe it i'm not taking his judgment now i 
don't know that i would ever have acted on that feeling or idea if this 
thing hadn't come up i don't know that i am going to do so finally 
but it strikes me that you are in a very ticklish positionone rather dangerous to 
this house and you know that this house could never brook a scandal why the 
newspapers would never get over it it would do us infinite harm i think viewing 
it all in all that you had better take a year off and see if 
you can't straighten this out quietly i don't think you had better try to take 
this girl unless you can get a divorce and marry her and i don't think 
you had better try to get a divorce unless you can do it quietly i 
mean so far as your position here is concerned only apart from that you can 
do what you please but remember a scandal would affect your usefulness here if things 
can be patched up well and good if not well then they can't if this 
thing gets talked about much you know that there will be no hope of your 
coming back here i don't suppose you would be willing to give her up no 
said eugene i thought as much i know just how you take a thing of 
this kind it hits your type hard can you get a divorce from mrs witla 
i'm not so sure said eugene i haven't any suitable grounds we simply don't agree 
that's allmy life has been a hollow shell well said colfax it's a bad mix 
up all around i know how you feel about the girl she's very beautiful she's 
just the sort to bring about a situation of this kind i don't want to 
tell you what to do you are your own best judge but if you will 
take my advice you won't try to live with her without first marrying her a 
man in your position can't afford to do it you're too much in the public 
eye you know you have become fairly conspicuous in new york during the last few 
years don't you yes said eugene i thought i had arranged that matter with mrs 
dale it appears not she tells me that you are trying to persuade her daughter 
to live with you that you have no means of obtaining a divorce within a 
reasonable time that your wife is in apardon me and that you insist on associating 
with her daughter meanwhile which isn't possible according to her i'm inclined to think she's 
right it's hard but it can't be helped she says that you say that if 
you are not allowed to do that you will take her and live with her 
he paused again will you yes said eugene colfax twisted slowly in his chair and 
looked out of the window what a man what a curious thing love was when 
is it he asked finally that you think you might do this oh i don't 
know i'm all tangled up now i'll have to think colfax meditated it's a peculiar 
business few people would understand this as well as i do few people would understand 
you witla as i do you haven't calculated right old man and you'll have to 
pay the price we all do i can't let you stay here i wish i 
could but i can't you'll have to take a year off and think this thing 
out if nothing happensif no scandal ariseswell i won't say what i'll do i might 
make a berth for you here somewherenot exactly in the same position perhaps but somewhere 
i'll have to think about that meanwhilehe stopped and thought again eugene was seeing clearly 
how it was with him all this talk about coming back meant nothing the thing 
that was apparent in colfax's mind was that he would have to go and the 
reason that he would have to go was not mrs dale or suzanne or the 
moral issue involved but the fact that he had lost colfax's confidence in him somehow 
through white through mrs dale through his own actions day in and day out colfax 
had come to the conclusion that he was erratic uncertain and for that reason nothing 
else he was being dispensed with now it was suzanneit was fate his own unfortunate 
temperament he brooded pathetically and then he said: when do you want this to happen 
oh any time the quicker the better if a public scandal is to grow out 
of it if you want you can take your time three weeks a month six 
weeks you had better make it a matter of health and resign for your own 
goodi mean the looks of the thing that won't make any difference in my subsequent 
conclusions this place is arranged so well now that it can run nicely for a 
year without much trouble we might fix this up againit depends eugene wished he had 
not added the last hypocritical phrase he shook hands and went to the door and 
eugene strolled to the window here was all the solid foundation knocked from under him 
at one fell stroke as if by a cannon he had lost this truly magnificent 
position a year where would he get another like it who elsewhat other company could 
pay any such salary how could he maintain the riverside drive apartment now unless he 
married suzanne how could he have his automobilehis valet colfax said nothing about continuing his 
incomewhy should he he really owed him nothing he had been exceedingly well paidbetter paid 
than he would have been anywhere else he regretted his fanciful dreams about blue seahis 
silly enthusiasm in tying up all his money in that would mrs dale go to 
winfield would her talk do him any real harm there winfield had always been a 
good friend to him had manifested a high regard this charge this talk of abduction 
what a pity it all was it might change winfield's attitude and still why should 
it he had women no wife however he hadn't as colfax said planned this thing 
quite right that was plain now his shimmering world of dreams was beginning to fade 
like an evening sky it might be that he had been chasing a willo'thewisp after 
all could this really be possible could it be chapter xxii one would have thought 
that this terrific blow would have given eugene pause in a way and it did 
it frightened him mrs dale had gone to colfax in order to persuade him to 
use his influence to make eugene behave himself and having done so much she was 
actually prepared to go further she was considering some scheme whereby she could blacken eugene 
have his true character become known without in any way involving suzanne having been relentlessly 
pursued and harried by eugene she was now as relentless in her own attitude she 
wanted him to let go now entirely if she could not to see suzanne any 
more and she went first to winfield and then back to lenox with the hope 
of preventing any further communication or at least action on suzanne's part or eugene's possible 
presence there in so far as her visit to winfield was concerned it did not 
amount to so much morally or emotionally in that quarter for winfield did not feel 
that he was called upon to act in the matter he was not eugene's guardian 
nor yet a public censor of morals he waived the whole question grandly to one 
side though in a way he was glad to know of it for it gave 
him an advantage over eugene he was sorry for him a littlewhat man would not 
be nevertheless in his thoughts of reorganizing the blue sea corporation he did not feel 
so bad over what might become of eugene's interests when the latter approached him as 
he did some time afterward with the idea that he might be able to dispose 
of his holdings he saw no way to do it the company was really not 
in good shape more money would have to be put in all the treasury stock 
would have to be quickly disposed of or a reorganization would have to be effected 
the best that could be promised under these circumstances was that eugene's holdings might be 
exchanged for a fraction of their value in a new issue by a new group 
of directors so eugene saw the end of his dreams in that direction looming up 
quite clearly when he saw what mrs dale had done he saw also that it 
was necessary to communicate the situation clearly to suzanne the whole thing pulled him up 
short and he began to wonder what was to become of him with his twentyfive 
thousand a year in salary cut off his prospect of an independent fortune in blue 
sea annihilated the old life closed to him for want of cash for who can 
go about in society without money he saw that he was in danger of complete 
social and commercial extinction if by any chance a discussion of the moral relation between 
him and suzanne arose his unconscionable attitude toward angela if white heard of it for 
instance what would become of him the latter would spread the fact far and wide 
it would be the talk of the town in the publishing world at least it 
would close every publishing house in the city to him he did not believe colfax 
would talk he fancied that mrs dale had not after all spoken to winfield but 
if she had how much further would it go would white hear of it through 
colfax would he keep it a secret if he knew never the folly of what 
he had been doing began to dawn upon him dimly what was it that he 
had been doing he felt like a man who had been cast into a deep 
sleep by a powerful opiate and was now slowly waking to a dim wondering sense 
of where he was he was in new york he had no position he had 
little ready moneyperhaps five or six thousand all told he had the love of suzanne 
but her mother was still fighting him and he had angela on his hands undivorced 
how was he to arrange things now how could he think of going back to 
her never he sat down and composed the following letter to suzanne which he thought 
would make clear to her just how things stood and give her an opportunity to 
retract if she wished for he thought he owed that much to her now: flower 
face: i had a talk with mr colfax this morning and what i feared might 
happen has happened your mother instead of going to boston as you thought came to 
new york and saw him and i fancy my friend winfield too she cannot do 
me any harm in that direction for my relationship with that company does not depend 
on a salary or a fixed income of any kind but she has done me 
infinite harm here frankly i have lost my position i do not believe that would 
have come about except for other pressure with which she had nothing to do but 
her charges and complaints coming on top of opposition here on the part of someone 
else has done what she couldn't have done alone flower face do you know what 
that means i told you once that i had tied up all my spare cash 
in blue sea which i hoped would come to so much it may but the 
cutting off my salary here means great changes for me there unless i can make 
some other business engagement immediately i shall probably have to give up my apartment in 
riverside drive and my automobile and in other ways trim my sails to meet the 
bad weather it means that if you come to me we should have to live 
on what i can earn as an artist unless i should decide and be able 
to find something else when i came to canada for you i had some such 
idea in mind but since this thing has actually happened you may think differently if 
nothing happens to my blue sea investment there may be an independent fortune some day 
in that i can't tell but that is a long way off and meanwhile there 
is only this and i don't know what else your mother may do to my 
reputation she appears to be in a very savage frame of mind you heard what 
she said at whileaway she has evidently gone back on that completely flower face i 
lay this all before you so that you may see how things are if you 
come to me it may be in the face of a faded reputation you must 
realize that there is a great difference between eugene witla managing publisher of the united 
magazines corporation and eugene witla artist i have been very reckless and defiant in my 
love for you because you are so lovelythe most perfect thing that i have ever 
known i have laid all on the altar of my affection i would do it 
again gladlya thousand times before you came my life was a gloomy thing i thought 
i was living but i knew in my heart that it was all a dusty 
shella lie then you came and oh how i have lived the nights the days 
of beautiful fancy shall i ever forget white wood or blue sea or briarcliff or 
that wonderful first day at south beach little girl our ways have been the ways 
of perfectness and peace this has been an intensely desperate thing to do but for 
my sake i am not sorry i have been dreaming a wonderfully sweet and perfect 
dream it may be when you know all and see how things stand and stop 
and think as i now ask you to do you may be sorry and want 
to change your mind don't hesitate to do so if you feel that way you 
know i told you to think calmly long ago before you told your mother this 
is a bold original thing we have been planning it is not to be expected 
that the world would see it as we have it is quite to be expected 
that trouble would follow in the wake of it but it seemed possible to me 
and still seems so if you want to come to me say so if you 
want me to come to you speak the word we will go to england or 
italy and i will try my hand at painting again i can do that i 
am sure or we can stay here and i can see if some engagement cannot 
be had you want to remember though that your mother may not have finished fighting 
she may go to much greater lengths than she has gone you thought you might 
control her but it seems not i thought we had won in canada but it 
appears not if she attempts to restrain you from using your share of your father's 
estate she may be able to cause you trouble there if she attempts to incarcerate 
you she might be successful i wish i could talk to you can't i see 
you at lenox are you coming home next week we ought to think and plan 
and act now if at all don't let any consideration for me stand in your 
way though if you are doubtful remember that conditions are different now your whole future 
hangs on your decision i should have talked this way long ago perhaps but i 
did not think your mother could do what she has succeeded in doing i did 
not think my financial standing would play any part in it flower face this is 
the day of real trial for me i am unhappy but only at the possible 
prospect of losing you nothing of all these other things really matters with you everything 
would be perfect whatever my condition might be without you it will be as dark 
as night the decision is in your hands and you must act whatever you decide 
that i will do don't as i say let consideration for me stand in the 
way you are young you have a social career before you after all i am 
twice your age i talk thus sanely because if you come to me now i 
want you to understand clearly how you come oh i wonder sometimes if you really 
understand i wonder if i have been dreaming a dream you are so beautiful you 
have been such an inspiration to me has this been a lurea willo'the wisp i 
wonder i wonder and yet i love you love you love you a thousand kisses 
divine fire and i wait for your word eugene suzanne read this letter at lenox 
and for the first time in her life she began to think and ponder seriously 
what had she been doing what was eugene doing this dénouement frightened her her mother 
was more purposeful than she imagined to think of her going to colfaxof her lying 
and turning so in her moods she had not thought this possible of her mother 
had not thought it possible that eugene could lose his position he had always seemed 
so powerful to her so much a law unto himself once when they were out 
in an automobile together he had asked her why she loved him and she said 
because you are a genius and can do anything you please oh no he answered 
nothing like that i can't really do very much of anything you just have an 
exaggerated notion of me oh no i haven't she replied you can paint and you 
can writeshe was judging by some of the booklets about blue sea and verses about 
herself and clippings of articles done in his old chicago newspaper days which he showed 
her once in a scrapbook in his apartmentand you can run that office and you 
were an advertising manager and an art director she lifted up her face and looked 
into his eyes admiringly my what a list of accomplishments he replied well whom the 
gods would destroy they first make mad he kissed her and you love so beautifully 
she added by way of climax since then she had thought of this often but 
now somehow it received a severe setback he was not quite so powerful he could 
not prevent her mother from doing this and could she really conquer her mother whatever 
suzanne might think of her deceit she was moving heaven and earth to prevent this 
was she wholly wrong after that climacteric night at st jacques when somehow the expected 
did not happen suzanne had been thinking did she really want to leave home and 
go with eugene did she want to fight her mother in regard to her estate 
she might have to do that her original idea had been that she and eugene 
would meet in some lovely studio and that she would keep her own home and 
he would have his it was something very different this talk of poverty and not 
having an automobile and being far away from home still she loved him maybe she 
could force her mother to terms yet there were more struggles in the two or 
three succeeding days in which the guardian of the estatemr herbert pitcairn of the marquardt 
trust company and once more dr woolley were called in to argue with her suzanne 
unable to make up her mind listened to her mother's insidious plea that if she 
would wait a year and then say she really wanted him she could have him 
listened to mr pitcairn tell her mother that he believed any court would on application 
adjudge her incompetent and tie up her estate heard dr woolley say in her presence 
to her mother that he did not deem a commission in lunacy advisable but if 
her mother insisted no doubt a judge would adjudge her insane if no more than 
to prevent this unhallowed consummation suzanne became frightened her iron nerve after eugene's letter was 
weakening she was terribly incensed against her mother but she began now for the first 
time to think what her friends would think supposing her mother did lock her up 
where would they think she was all these days and weeks of strain which had 
worn her mother threadbare had told something on her own strength or rather nerve it 
was too intense and she began to wonder whether they had not better do as 
eugene suggested and wait a little while he had agreed up at st jacques to 
wait if she were willing only the provision was that they were to see each 
other now her mother had changed front again pleading danger undue influence that she ought 
to have at least a year of her old kind of life undisturbed to see 
whether she really cared how can you tell she insisted to suzanne in spite of 
the girl's desire not to talk you have been swept into this and you haven't 
given yourself time to think a year won't hurt what harm will it do you 
or him but mama asked suzanne over and over at different times and in different 
places why did you go and tell mr colfax what a mean cruel thing that 
was to do because i think he needs something like that to make him pause 
and think he isn't going to starve he is a man of talent he needs 
something like that to bring him to his senses mr colfax hasn't discharged him he 
told me he wouldn't he said he would make him take a year off and 
think about it and that's just what he has done it won't hurt him i 
don't care if it does look at the way he has made me suffer she 
felt exceedingly bitter toward eugene and was rejoicing that at last she was beginning to 
have her innings mama said suzanne i am never going to forgive you for this 
you are acting horriblyi will wait but it will come to the same thing in 
the end i am going to have him i don't care what you do after 
a year said mrs dale cheerfully and subtly if you will just wait that long 
and give yourself time to think and still want to marry him you can do 
so he can probably get a divorce in that time anyhow she did not mean 
what she was saying but any argument was good for the situation if it delayed 
matters but i don't know that i want to marry him insisted suzanne doggedly harking 
back to her original idea that isn't my theory of it oh well replied mrs 
dale complaisantly you will know better what to think of that after a year i 
don't want to coerce you but i'm not going to have our home and happiness 
broken up in this way without turning a hand and without your stopping to think 
about it you owe it to meto all these years i have cared for you 
to show me some consideration a year won't hurt you it won't hurt him you 
will find out then whether he really loves you or not this may just be 
a passing fancy he has had other women before you he may have others after 
you he may go back to mrs witla it doesn't make any difference what he 
tells you you ought to test him before you break up his home and mine 
if he really loves you he will agree readily enough do this for me suzanne 
and i will never cross your path any more if you will wait a year 
you can do anything you choose i can only hope you won't go to him 
without going as his wife but if you insist i will hush the matter up 
as best i can write to him and tell him that you have decided that 
you both ought to wait a year you don't need to see him any more 
it will just stir things all up afresh if you don't see him but just 
write it will be better for him too he won't feel so badly as he 
will if you see him again and go all over the ground once more mrs 
dale was terribly afraid of eugene's influence but she could not accomplish this i won't 
do that said suzanne i won't do it i'm going back to new york that's 
all there is about it mrs dale finally yielded that much she had to there 
was a letter from suzanne after three days saying that she couldn't answer his letter 
in full but that she was coming back to new york and would see him 
and subsequently a meeting between suzanne and eugene at daleview in her mother's presencedr woolley 
and mr pitcairn were in another part of the house at the timein which the 
proposals were gone over anew eugene had motored down after mrs dale's demands had been 
put before him in the gloomiest and yet more feverish frame of mind in which 
he had ever beengloomy because of heavy forebodings of evil and his own dark financial 
conditionwhile inspirited at other moments by thoughts of some splendid eager revolt on the part 
of suzanne of her rushing to him defying all declaring herself violently and convincingly and 
so coming off a victor with him his faith in her love was still so 
great the night was one of those cold october ones with a steely sky and 
a sickle moon harbinger of frost newly seen in the west and pointed stars thickening 
overhead as he sat in his car on the staten island ferry boat he could 
see a long line of southward bound ducks homing to those reedy marshes which bryant 
had in mind when he wrote to a waterfowl they were honking as they went 
their faint quacks coming back on the thin air and making him feel desperately lonely 
and bereft when he reached daleview speeding past october trees and entered the great drawingroom 
where a fire was blazing and where once in spring he had danced with suzanne 
his heart leaped up for he was to see her and the mere sight of 
her was as a tonic to his fevered bodya cool drink to a thirsting man 
mrs dale stared at eugene defiantly when he came but suzanne welcomed him to her 
embrace oh she exclaimed holding him close for a few moments and breathing feverishly there 
was complete silence for a time mama insists eugene she said after a time that 
we ought to wait a year and i think since there is such a fuss 
about it that perhaps it might be just as well we may have been just 
a little hasty don't you think i have told mama what i think about her 
action in going to mr colfax but she doesn't seem to care she is threatening 
now to have me adjudged insane a year won't make any real difference since i 
am coming to you anyhow will it but i thought i ought to tell you 
this in person to ask you about itshe paused looking into his eyes i thought 
we settled all this up in st jacques said eugene turning to mrs dale but 
experiencing a sinking sensation of fear we did all except the matter of not seeing 
her i think it is highly inadvisable that you two should be together it isn't 
possible the way things stand people will talk your wife's condition has to be adjusted 
you can't be running around with her and a child coming to you i want 
suzanne to go away for a year where she can be calm and think it 
all out and i want you to let her if she still insists that she 
wants you after that and will not listen to the logic of the situation in 
regard to marriage then i propose to wash my hands of the whole thing she 
may have her inheritance she may have you if she wants you if you have 
come to your senses by that time as i hope you will have you will 
get a divorce or go back to mrs witla or do whatever you do in 
a sensible way she did not want to incense eugene here but she was very 
bitter eugene merely frowned is this your decision suzanne too he asked wearily i think 
mama is terrible eugene replied suzanne evasively or perhaps as a reply to her mother 
you and i have planned our lives and we will work them out we have 
been a little selfish now that i think of it i think a year won't 
do any harm perhaps if it will stop all this fussing i can wait if 
you can an inexpressible sense of despair fell upon eugene at the sound of this 
a sadness so deep that he could scarcely speak he could not believe that it 
was really suzanne who was saying that to him willing to wait a year she 
who had declared so defiantly that she would not it would do no harm to 
think that life fate her mother were triumphing over him in this fashion after all 
what then was the significance of the blackbearded men he had seen so often of 
late why had he been finding horseshoes was fate such a liar did life in 
its dark subtle chambers lay lures and traps for men his position gone his blue 
sea venture involved in an indefinite delay out of which might come nothing suzanne going 
for a whole year perhaps for ever most likely so for what could not her 
mother do with her in a whole year having her alone angela alienateda child approaching 
what a climax is this really your decision suzanne he asked sadly a mist of 
woe clouding his whole being i think it ought to be perhaps eugene she replied 
still evasively it's very trying i will be faithful to you though i promise you 
that i will not change don't you think we can wait a year we can 
can't we a whole year without seeing you suzanne yes it will pass eugene a 
whole year yes eugene i have nothing more to say mrs dale he said turning 
to her mother solemnly a sombre gloomy light in his eye his heart hardening towards 
suzanne for the moment to think she should treat him sothrow him down as he 
phrased it well such was life you win he added it has been a terrible 
experience for me a terrible passion i love this girl i love her with my 
whole heart sometimes i have vaguely suspected that she might not know he turned to 
suzanne and for the first time he thought that he did not see there that 
true understanding which he had fancied had been there all the time could fate have 
been lying to him also in this was he mistaken in this and had he 
been following a phantom lure of beauty was suzanne but another trap to drag him 
down to his old nothingness god the prediction of the astrologer of a second period 
of defeat after seven or eight years came back oh suzanne he said simply and 
unconsciously dramatic do you really love me yes eugene she replied really yes he held 
out his arms and she came but for the life of him he could not 
dispel this terrible doubt it took the joy out of his kissas if he had 
been dreaming a dream of something perfect in his arms and had awaked to find 
it nothingas if life had sent him a judas in the shape of a girl 
to betray him do let us end this mr witla said mrs dale coldly there 
is nothing to be gained by delaying let us end it for a year and 
then talk oh suzanne he continued as mournful as a passing bell come to the 
door with me no the servants are there put in mrs dale please make your 
farewells here mama said suzanne angrily and defiantly moved by the pity of it i 
won't have you talk this way leave the room or i shall go to the 
door with him and further leave us please mrs dale went out oh flower face 
said eugene pathetically i can't believe it i can't i can't this has been managed 
wrong i should have taken you long ago so it is to end this way 
a year a whole year and how much longer only a year she insisted only 
a year believe me can't you i won't change i won't he shook his head 
and suzanne as before took his face in her hands she kissed his cheeks his 
lips his hair believe me eugene i seem cold you don't know what i have 
gone through it is nothing but trouble everywhere let us wait a year i promise 
you i will come to you i swear one year can't we wait one year 
a year he said a year i can't believe it where will we all be 
in a year oh flower face myrtle bloom divine fire i can't stand this i 
can't it's too much i'm the one who is paying now yes i pay he 
took her face and looked at it all its soft enticing features her eyes her 
lips her cheeks her hair i thought i thought he murmured suzanne only stroked the 
back of his head with her hands well if i must i must he said 
he turned away turned back to embrace her turned again and then without looking back 
walked out into the hall mrs dale was there waiting good night mrs dale he 
said gloomily good night mr witla she replied frigidly but with a sense of something 
tragic in her victory at that he took his hat and walked out outside the 
bright october stars were in evidence by millions the bay and harbor of new york 
were as wonderfully lit as on that night when suzanne came to him after the 
evening at fort wadsworth on her own porch he recalled the spring odours the wonderful 
feel of youth and lovethe hope that was springing then now it was five or 
six months later and all that romance was gone suzanne sweet voice accomplished shape light 
whisper delicate touch gone all gone faded the flower and all its budded charms faded 
the sight of beauty from my eyes faded the shape of beauty from my arms 
faded the voice warmth whiteness paradise gone were those bright days in which they had 
ridden together dined together walked in sylvan places beside their car a little way from 
here he first played tennis with her a little way from here he had come 
so often to meet her clandestinely now she was gonegone he had come in his 
car but he really did not want it life was accursed his own was a 
failure to think that all his fine dreams should crumble this way shortly he would 
have no car no home on riverside drive no position no anything god i can't 
stand this he exclaimed and a little laterby god i can't i can't he dismissed 
his car at the battery telling his chauffeur to take it to the garage and 
walking gloomily through all the tall dark streets of lower new york here was broadway 
where he had often been with colfax and winfield here was this great world of 
finance around wall street in which he had vaguely hoped to shine now these buildings 
were high and silentreceding from him in a way overhead were the clear bright stars 
cool and refreshing but without meaning to him now how was he to settle it 
how adjust it a year she would never come backnever it was all gone a 
bright cloud faded a mirage dissolved into its native nothingness position distinction love homewhere were 
they yet a little while and all these things would be as though they had 
never been hell damn curse the brooding fates that could thus plot to destroy him 
back in her room in daleview suzanne had locked herself in she was not without 
a growing sense of the tragedy of it she stared at the floor recalled his 
face oh oh she said and for the first time in her life felt as 
though she could cry from a great heartachebut she could not and in riverside drive 
was another woman brooding lonely despondently desperately over the nature of the tragedy that was 
upon her how were things to be adjusted how was she to be saved oh 
oh her life her child if eugene could be made to understand if he could 
only be made to see chapter xxiii during the weeks which followed colfax's talk with 
him and suzanne's decision which amounted practically to a dismissal eugene tried to wind up 
his affairs at the united magazines corporation as well as straighten out his relationship with 
angela it was no easy task colfax helped him considerably by suggesting that he should 
say he was going abroad for the company for the time being and should make 
it appear imperative that he go at once eugene called in his department heads and 
told them what colfax suggested but added that his own interests elsewhere of which they 
knew or suspected were now so involved that he might possibly not return or only 
for a little while at best he put forward an air of great sufficiency and 
selfsatisfaction considering the difficulties he was encountering and the thing passed off as a great 
wonder but with no suspicion of any immediate misfortune attaching to him as a matter 
of fact it was assumed that he was destined to a much higher estatethe control 
of his private interests in his talk with angela he made it perfectly plain that 
he was going to leave her he would not make any pretence about this she 
ought to know he had lost his position he was not going to suzanne soon 
he wanted her to leave him or he would leave her she should go to 
wisconsin or europe or anywhere for the time being and leave him to fight this 
thing out alone he was not indispensable to her in her condition there were nurses 
she could hirematernity hospitals where she could stay he would be willing to pay for 
that he would never live with her any more if he could help ithe did 
not want to the sight of her in the face of his longing for suzanne 
would be a wretched commentarya reproach and a sore shame no he would leave her 
and perhaps possibly sometime when she obtained more real fighting courage suzanne might come to 
him she ought to angela might die yes brutal as it may seem he thought 
this she might die and thenand then no thought of the child that might possibly 
live even if she died held him he could not understand that could not grasp 
it as yet it was a mere abstraction eugene took a room in an apartment 
house in kingsbridge where he was not known for the time being and where he 
was not likely to be seen then there was witnessed that dreary spectacle of a 
man whose life has apparently come down in a heap whose notions emotions tendencies and 
feelings are confused and disappointed by some untoward result if eugene had been ten or 
fifteen years older the result might have been suicide a shade of difference in temperament 
might have resulted in death murder anything as it was he sat blankly at times 
among the ruins of his dreams speculating on what suzanne was doing on what angela 
was doing on what people were saying and thinking on how he could gather up 
the broken pieces of his life and make anything out of them at all the 
one saving element in it all was his natural desire to work which although it 
did not manifest itself at first by degrees later on began to come back he 
must do something if it was not anything more than to try to paint again 
he could not be running around looking for a position there was nothing for him 
in connection with blue sea he had to work to support angela of whom he 
was now free if he did not want to be mean and as he viewed 
it all in the light of what had happened he realized that he had been 
bad enough she had not been temperamentally suited to him but she had tried to 
be fundamentally it was not her fault how was he to work and live and 
be anything at all from now on there were long arguments over this situation between 
him and angelapleas tears a crashing downward of everything which was worth while in life 
to angela and then in spite of her pathetic situation separation because it was november 
and the landlord had heard of eugene's financial straits or rather reverse of fortune it 
was possible to relinquish the lease which had several years to run and the apartment 
was given up angela distraught scarcely knew which way to turn it was one of 
those pitiless scandalous situations in life which sicken us of humanity she ran helplessly to 
eugene's sister myrtle who first tried to conceal the scandal and tragedy from her husband 
but afterward confessed and deliberated as to what should be done frank bangs who was 
a practical man as well as firm believer in christian science because of his wife's 
to him miraculous healing from a tumor several years before endeavored to apply his understanding 
of the divine sciencethe omnipresence of good to this situation there is no use worrying 
about it myrtle he said to his wife who in spite of her faith was 
temporarily shaken and frightened by the calamities which seemingly had overtaken her brother it's another 
evidence of the workings of mortal mind it is real enough in its idea of 
itself but nothing in god's grace it will come out all right if we think 
right angela can go to a maternity hospital for the time being or whenever she's 
ready we may be able to persuade eugene to do the right thing angela was 
persuaded to consult a christian science practitioner and myrtle went to the woman who had 
cured her and begged her to use her influence or rather her knowledge of science 
to effect a rehabilitation for her brother she was told that this could not be 
done without his wish but that she would pray for him if he could be 
persuaded to come of his own accord seeking spiritual guidance or divine aid it would 
be a different matter in spite of his errors and to her they seemed palpable 
and terrible enough at present her faith would not allow her to reproach him and 
besides she loved him he was a strong man she said always strange he and 
angela might not have been well mated but all could be righted in science there 
was a dreary period of packing and storing for angela in which she stood about 
amid the ruins of her previous comfort and distinction and cried over the things that 
had seemed so lovely to her here were all eugene's things his paintings his canes 
his pipes his clothes she cried over a handsome silk dressing gown in which he 
had been wont to lounge aboutit smacked so much curiously of older and happier days 
there were hard cold and determined conferences also in which some of angela's old fighting 
ruling spirit would come back but not for long she was beaten now and she 
knew itwrecked the roar of a cold and threatening sea was in her ears it 
should be said here that at one time suzanne truly imagined she loved eugene it 
must be remembered however that she was moved to affection for him by the wonder 
of a personality that was hypnotic to her there was something about the personality of 
eugene that was subversive of conventionality he approached apparently a lamb of conventional feelings and 
appearances whereas inwardly he was a ravening wolf of indifference to convention all the organized 
modes and methods of life were a joke to him he saw through to something 
that was not material life at all but spiritual or say immaterial of which all 
material things were a shadow what did the great forces of life care whether this 
system which was maintained here with so much show and fuss was really maintained at 
all or not how could they care he once stood in a morgue and saw 
human bodies apparently dissolving into a kind of chemical mush and he had said to 
himself then how ridiculous it was to assume that life meant anything much to the 
forces which were doing these things great chemical and physical forces were at work which 
permitted accidentally perhaps some little shadowplay which would soon pass but oh its presencehow sweet 
it was naturally suzanne was cast down for the time being for she was capable 
of suffering just as eugene was but having given her word to wait she decided 
to stick to that although she had not stuck to her other she was between 
nineteen and twenty noweugene was nearing forty life could still soothe her in spite of 
herself in eugene's case it could only hurt the more mrs dale went abroad with 
suzanne and the other children visiting with people who could not possibly have heard or 
ever would except in a vague uncertain way for that matter if it became evident 
as she thought it might that there was to be a scandal mrs dale proposed 
to say that eugene had attempted to establish an insidious hold on her child in 
defiance of reason and honor and that she had promptly broken it up shielding suzanne 
almost without the latter's knowledge it was plausible enough what was he to do now 
how live was his constant thought go into a wee small apartment in some back 
street with angela where he and she if he decided to stay with her could 
find a pretty outlook for a little money and live never admit that he had 
lost suzanne for a year at least if not permanently in this suddenly brusque way 
impossible go and confess that he had made a mistake which he still did not 
feel to be true or that he was sorry and would like to patch things 
up as before never he was not sorry he did not propose to live with 
angela in the old way any more he was sick of her or rather of 
that atmosphere of repression and convention in which he had spent so many years he 
was sick of the idea of having a child thrust on him against his will 
he would not do it she had no business to put herself in this position 
he would die first his insurance was paid up to date he had carried during 
the last five years a policy for something over eighteen thousand in her favor and 
if he died she would get that he wished he might it would be some 
atonement for the hard knocks which fate had recently given her but he did not 
wish to live with her any more never never child or no child go back 
to the apartment after this nighthow could he if he did he must pretend that 
nothing had happenedat least nothing untoward between him and suzanne she might come back might 
might ah the mockery of itto leave him in this way when she really could 
have come to himshould haveoh the bitterness of this thrust of fate there was a 
day when the furniture was sent away and angela went to live with myrtle for 
the time being there was another tearful hour when she left new york to visit 
her sister marietta at racine where they now were intending to tell her before she 
came away as a profound secret the terrible tragedy which had overtaken her eugene went 
to the train with her but with no desire to be there angela's one thought 
in all this was that somehow time would effect a reconciliation if she could just 
wait long enough if she could keep her peace and live and not die and 
not give him a divorce he might eventually recover his sanity and come to think 
of her as at least worth living with the child might do it its coming 
would be something that would affect him surely he was bound to see her through 
it she told herself she was willing and delighted to go through this ordeal if 
only it brought him back to her this childwhat a reception it was to receive 
unwanted dishonored before its arrival ignored if by any chance she should die what would 
he do about it surely he would not desert it already in her nervous melancholy 
way she was yearning toward it tell me she said to eugene one day when 
they were alternately quarreling and planning if the baby comes and iand idie you won't 
absolutely desert it you'll take it won't you i'll take it he replied don't worry 
i'm not an absolute dog i didn't want it it's a trick on your part 
but i'll take it i don't want you to die you know that angela thought 
if she lived that she would be willing to go through a period of poverty 
and depression with him again if only she could live to see him sane and 
moral and even semisuccessful the baby might do it he had never had a child 
and much as he disliked the idea now still when it was here he might 
change his mind if only she could get through that ordeal she was so oldher 
muscles so set meanwhile she consulted a lawyer a doctor a fortune teller an astrologer 
and the christian science practitioner to whom myrtle had recommended her it was an aimless 
ridiculous combination but she was badly torn up and any port seemed worth while in 
this storm the doctor told her that her muscles were rather set but with the 
regimen he prescribed he was satisfied she would be all right the astrologer told her 
that she and eugene were fated for this storm by the starseugene particularly and that 
he might recover in which case he would be successful again in a measure as 
for herself he shook his head yes she would be all right he was lying 
the fortune teller laid the cards to see if eugene would ever marry suzanne and 
angela was momentarily gratified to learn that she would never enter his lifethis from a 
semicadaverous but richly dressed and bejeweled lady whose anteroom was filled with women whose troubles 
were of the heart the loss of money the enmity of rivals or the dangers 
of childbirth the christian science practitioner declared all to be divine mindomnipotent omnipresent omniscient good 
and that evil could not exist in itonly the illusion of it it is real 
enough to those who give it their faith and believe said the counselor but without 
substance or meaning to those who know themselves to be a perfect indestructible reflection of 
an idea in god god is a principle when the nature of that principle is 
realized and yourself as a part of it evil falls away as the troublesome dream 
that it is it has no reality she assured her that no evil could befall 
her in the true understanding of science god is love the lawyer told her after 
listening to a heated story of eugene's misconduct that under the laws of the state 
of new york in which these misdeeds were committed she was not entitled to anything 
more than a very small fraction of her husband's estate if he had any two 
years was the shortest time in which a divorce could be secured he would advise 
her to sue if she could establish a suitable condition of affluence on eugene's part 
not otherwise then he charged her twentyfive dollars for this advice chapter xxiv to those 
who have followed a routine or system of living in this worldwho have by slow 
degrees and persistent effort built up a series of habits tastes refinements emotions and methods 
of conduct and have in addition achieved a certain distinction and position so that they 
have said to one go and he goes and to another come and he comes 
who have enjoyed without stint or reserve let or hindrance those joys of perfect freedom 
of action and that ease and deliberation which comes with the presence of comparative wealth 
social position and comforts the narrowing that comes with the lack of means the fear 
of public opinion or the shame of public disclosure is one of the most pathetic 
discouraging and terrifying things that can be imagined these are the hours that try men's 
souls the man who sits in a seat of the mighty and observes a world 
that is ruled by a superior power a superior force of which he by some 
miraculous generosity of fate has been chosen apparently as a glittering instrument has no conception 
of the feelings of the man who cast out of his dignities and emoluments sits 
in the dark places of the world among the ashes of his splendor and meditates 
upon the glory of his bygone days there is a pathos here which passes the 
conception of the average man the prophets of the old testament discerned it clearly enough 
for they were forever pronouncing the fate of those whose follies were in opposition to 
the course of righteousness and who were made examples of by a beneficent and yet 
awful power thus saith the lord: because thou hast lifted thyself up against the god 
of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou 
and thy lords thy wives and concubines have drank wine in them and thou hast 
praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone god hath 
numbered thy kingdom and finished it thou art weighed in the balance and found wanting 
thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and the persians eugene was in 
a minor way an exemplification of this seeming course of righteousness his kingdom small as 
it was was truly at an end our social life is so organized so closely 
knit upon a warp of instinct that we almost always instinctively flee that which does 
not accord with custom usage preconceived notions and tendenciesthose various things which we in our 
littleness of vision conceive to be dominant who does not run from the man who 
may because of his deeds be condemned of that portion of the public which we 
chance to respect walk he ever so proudly carry himself with what circumspectness he may 
at the first breath of suspicion all are offfriends relations business acquaintances the whole social 
fabric in toto unclean is the cry unclean unclean and it does not matter how 
inwardly shabby we may be what whited sepulchres shining to the sun we run quickly 
it seems a tribute to that providence which shapes our ends which continues perfect in 
tendency however vilely we may overlay its brightness with the rust of our mortal corruption 
however imitative we may be angela had gone home by now to see her father 
who was now quite old and feeble and also down to alexandria to see eugene's 
mother who was also badly deteriorated in health i keep hoping against hope that your 
attitude will change toward me wrote angela let me hear from you if you will 
from time to time it can't make any difference in your course a word won't 
hurt and i am so lonely oh eugene if i could only dieif i only 
could no word as to the true state of things was given at either place 
angela pretended that eugene had long been sick of his commercial career and was owing 
to untoward conditions in the colfax company glad to return to his art for a 
period he might come home but he was very busy so she lied but she 
wrote myrtle fully of her hopes and more particularly her fears there were a number 
of conferences between eugene and myrtle for the latter because of their early companionship was 
very fond of him his traits the innocent ones were as sweet to her as 
when they were boy and girl together she sought him out in his lovely room 
at kingsbridge why don't you come and stay with us eugene she pleaded we have 
a comfortable apartment you can have that big room next to ours it has a 
nice view frank likes you we have listened to angela and i think you are 
wrong but you are my brother and i want you to come everything is coming 
out right god will straighten it out frank and i are praying for you there 
is no evil you know according to the way we think nowand she smiled her 
oldtime girlish smiledon't stay up here alone wouldn't you rather be with me oh i'd 
like to be there well enough myrtle but i can't do it now i don't 
want to i have to think i want to be alone i haven't settled what 
i want to do i think i will try my hand at some pictures i 
have a little money and all the time i want now i see there are 
some nice houses over there on the hill that might have a room with a 
north window that would serve as a studio i want to think this thing out 
first i don't know what i'll do he had now that new pain in his 
groin which had come to him first when her mother first carried suzanne off to 
canada and he was afraid that he should never see her any more it was 
a real pain sharp physical like a cut with a knife he wondered how it 
was that it could be physical and down there his eyes hurt him and his 
finger tips wasn't that queer too why don't you go and see a christian science 
practitioner asked myrtle it won't do you any harm you don't need to believe let 
me get you the book and you can read it see if you don't think 
there is something in it there you go smiling sarcastically but eugene i can't tell 
you what it hasn't done for us it's done everythingthat's just all i'm a different 
person from what i was five years ago and so is frank you know how 
sick i was yes i know why don't you go and see mrs johns you 
needn't tell her anything unless you want to she has performed some perfectly wonderful cures 
what can mrs johns do for me asked eugene bitterly his lip set in an 
ironic mould cure me of gloom make my heart cease to ache what's the use 
of talking i ought to quit the whole thing he stared at the floor she 
can't but god can oh eugene i know how you feel please go it can't 
do you any harm i'll bring you the book tomorrow will you read it if 
i bring it to you no oh eugene please for my sake what good will 
it do i don't believe in it i can't i'm too intelligent to take any 
stock in that rot eugene how you talk you'll change your mind some time i 
know how you think but read it anyhow will you please promise me you will 
i shouldn't ask it isn't the way but i want you to look into it 
go and see mrs johns eugene refused of asinine things this seemed the silliest christian 
science christian rot he knew what to do his conscience was dictating that he give 
up suzanne and return to angela in her hour of needto his coming child for 
the time being anyhow but this awful lure of beauty of personality of lovehow it 
tugged at his soul oh those days with suzanne in the pretty watering and dining 
places about new york those hours of bliss when she looked so beautiful how could 
he get over that how give up the memory she was so sweet her beauty 
so rare every thought of her hurt it hurt so badly that most of the 
time he dared not thinkmust perforce walk or work or stir restlessly about agonized for 
fear he should think too much oh life oh hell the intrusion of christian science 
into his purview just now was due of course to the belief in and enthusiasm 
for that religious idea on the part of myrtle and her husband as at lourdes 
and st anne de beau pré and other miracleworking centres where hope and desire and 
religious enthusiasm for the efficacious intervention of a superior and nonmalicious force intervenes there had 
occurred in her case an actual cure from a very difficult and complicated physical ailment 
she had been suffering from a tumor nervous insomnia indigestion constipation and a host of 
allied ills which had apparently refused to yield to ordinary medical treatment she was in 
a very bad way mentally and physically at the time the christian science textbook science 
and health with key to the scriptures by mrs eddy was put into her hands 
while attempting to read it in a hopeless helpless spirit she was instantly curedthat is 
the idea that she was well took possession of her and not long after she 
really was so she threw all her medicines of which there was quite a store 
into the garbage pail eschewed doctors began to read the christian science literature and attend 
the christian science church nearest her apartment and was soon involved in its subtle metaphysical 
interpretation of mortal life into this faith her husband who loved her very much had 
followed for what was good enough for her and would cure her was good enough 
for him he soon seized on its spiritual significance with great vigor and became if 
anything a better exponent and interpreter of the significant thought than was she herself those 
who know anything of christian science know that its main tenet is that god is 
a principle not a personality understandable or conceivable from the mortal or sensory side of 
life which latter is an illusion and that man spiritually speaking in his image and 
likeness man is not god or any part of him he is an idea in 
god and as such as perfect and indestructible and undisturbably harmonious as an idea in 
god or principle must be to those not metaphysically inclined this is usually dark and 
without significance but to those spiritually or metaphysically minded it comes as a great light 
matter becomes a builtup set or combination of illusions which may have evolved or not 
as one chooses but which unquestionably have been built up from nothing or an invisible 
intangible idea and have no significance beyond the faith or credence which those who are 
at base spiritual give them deny themknow them to be what they areand they are 
gone to eugene who at this time was in a great state of mental doldrumsblue 
dispirited disheartened inclined to see only evil and destructive forcesthis might well come with peculiar 
significance if it came at all he was one of those men who from their 
birth are metaphysically inclined all his life he had been speculating on the subtleties of 
mortal existence reading spencer kant spinoza at odd moments and particularly such men as darwin 
huxley tyndall lord avebury alfred russel wallace and latterly sir oliver lodge and sir william 
crookes trying to find out by the inductive naturalistic method just what life was he 
had secured inklings at times he thought by reading such things as emerson's oversoul the 
meditations of marcus aurelius and plato god was a spirit he thought as christ had 
said to the woman at the well in samaria but whether this spirit concerned itself 
with mortal affairs where was so much suffering and contention was another matter personally he 
had never believed soor been at all sure he had always been moved by the 
sermon on the mount the beauty of christ's attitude toward the troubles of the world 
the wonder of the faith of the old prophets in insisting that god is god 
that there are no other gods before him and that he would repay iniquity with 
disfavor whether he did or not was an open question with him this question of 
sin had always puzzled himoriginal sin were there laws which antedated human experience which were 
in godthe wordbefore it was made flesh if so what were these laws did they 
concern matrimonysome spiritual union which was older than life itself did they concern stealing what 
was stealing outside of life where was it before man began or did it only 
begin with man ridiculous it must relate to something in chemistry and physics which had 
worked out in life a sociologista great professor in one of the colleges had once 
told him that he did not believe in success or failure sin or a sense 
of selfrighteousness except as they were related to builtup instincts in the raceinstincts related solely 
to the selfpreservation and the evolution of the race beyond that was nothing spiritual morality 
bah he knew nothing about it such rank agnosticism could not but have had its 
weight with eugene he was a doubter ever all life as i have said before 
went to pieces under his scalpel and he could not put it together again logically 
once he had it cut up people talked about the sanctity of marriage but heavens 
marriage was an evolution he knew that someone had written a twovolume treatise on itthe 
history of human marriage or something like that and in it animals were shown to 
have mated only for so long as it took to rear the young to get 
them to the point at which they could take care of themselves and wasn't this 
really what was at the basis of modern marriage he had read in this history 
if he recalled aright that the only reason marriage had come to be looked upon 
as sacred and for life was the length of time it took to rear the 
human young it took so long that the parents were old safely so before the 
children were launched into the world then why separate but it was the duty of 
everybody to raise children ah there had been the trouble he had been bothered by 
that the home centered around that children race reproduction pulling this wagon of evolution was 
every man who did not inevitably damned was the race spirit against him look at 
the men and women who didn'twho couldn't thousands and thousands and those who did always 
thought those who didn't were wrong the whole american spirit he had always felt to 
be intensely set in this directionthe idea of having children and rearing them a conservative 
workaday spirit look at his father and yet other men were so shrewd that they 
preyed on this spirit moving factories to where this race spirit was the most active 
so that they could hire the children cheaply and nothing happened to them or did 
something happen however myrtle continued to plead with him to look into this new interpretation 
of the scriptures claiming that it was true that it would bring him into an 
understanding of spirit which would drive away all these mortal ills that it was above 
all mortal conceptionspiritual over all and so he thought about that she told him that 
if it was right that he should cease to live with angela it would come 
to pass and that if it was not it would not but anyhow and in 
any event in this truth there would be peace and happiness to him he should 
do what was right seek ye first the kingdom of god and then all these 
things would be added unto him and it seemed terribly silly at first to eugene 
for him to be listening at all to any such talk but later it was 
not so much so there were long arguments and appeals breakfast and dinner or sunday 
dinners at myrtle's apartment arguments with bangs and myrtle concerning every phase of the science 
teaching some visits to the wednesday experience and testimony meetings of their church at which 
eugene heard statements concerning marvelous cures which he could scarcely believe and so on so 
long as the testimonies confined themselves to complaints which might be due to nervous imagination 
he was satisfied that their cures were possibly due to religious enthusiasm which dispelled their 
belief in something which they did not have but when they were cured of cancer 
consumption locomotorataxia goitres shortened limbs herniahe did not wish to say they were liars they 
seemed too sincere to do that but he fancied they were simply mistaken how could 
they or this belief or whatever it was cure cancer good lord he went on 
disbelieving in this way and refusing also to read the book until one wednesday evening 
when he happened to be at the fourth church of christ scientist in new york 
that a man stood up beside him in his own pew and said: i wish 
to testify to the love and mercy of god in my case for i was 
hopelessly afflicted not so very long ago and one of the vilest men i think 
it is possible to be i was raised in a family where the bible was 
read night and morningmy father was a hidebound presbyterianand i was so sickened by the 
manner in which it was forced down my throat and the inconsistencies which i thought 
i saw existing between christian principle and practice even in my own home that i 
said to myself i would conform as long as i was in my father's house 
and eating his bread but when i got out i would do as i pleased 
i was in my father's house after that a number of years until i was 
seventeen and then i went to a large city cincinnati but the moment i was 
away and free i threw aside all my socalled religious training and set out to 
do what i thought was the most pleasant and gratifying thing for me to do 
i wanted to drink and i did though i was really never a very successful 
drinker eugene smiled i wanted to gamble and i did but i was never a 
very clever gambler still i did gamble a bit my great weakness was women and 
here i hope none will be offended i know they will not be for there 
may be others who need my testimony badly i pursued women as i would any 
other lure they were really all that i desiredtheir bodies my lust was terrible it 
was such a dominant thought with me that i could not look at any goodlooking 
woman except as the bible says to lust after her i was vile i became 
diseased i was carried into the first church of christ scientist in chicago after i 
had spent all my money and five years of my time on physicians and specialists 
suffering from locomotor ataxia dropsy and kidney disease i had previously been healed of some 
other things by ordinary medicine if there is anyone within the sound of my voice 
who is afflicted as i was i want him to listen to me i want 
to say to you tonight that i am a well mannot well physically only but 
well mentally and what is better yet in so far as i can see the 
truth spiritually i was healed after six months' treatment by a christian science practitioner in 
chicago who took my case on my appealing to her and i stand before you 
absolutely sound and whole god is good he sat down while he had been talking 
eugene had been studying him closely observing every line of his features he was tall 
lean sandyhaired and sandybearded he was not badlooking with long straight nose clear blue eyes 
a light pinkish color to his complexion and a sense of vigor and health about 
him the thing that eugene noted most was that he was calm cool serene vital 
he said exactly what he wanted to say and he said it vigorously his voice 
was clear and with good carrying power his clothes were shapely new well made he 
was no beggar or tramp but a man of some professionan engineer very likely eugene 
wished that he might talk to him and yet he felt ashamed somehow this man's 
case paralleled his own not exactly but closely he personally was never diseased but how 
often he had looked after a perfectly charming woman to lust after her was the 
thing that this man was saying really true could he be lying how ridiculous could 
he be mistaken this man impossible he was too strong too keen too sincere too 
earnest to be either of these things stillbut this testimony might have been given for 
his benefit some strange helpful powerthat kindly fate that had always pursued him might be 
trying to reach him here could it be he felt a little strange about it 
as he had when he saw the blackbearded man entering the train that took him 
to three rivers the time he went at the call of suzanne as he did 
when horseshoes were laid before him by supernatural forces to warn him of coming prosperity 
he went home thinking and that night he seriously tried to read science and health 
for the first time chapter xxv those who have ever tried to read that very 
peculiar and to many very significant document know what an apparent jumble of contradictions and 
metaphysical balderdash it appears to be the statement concerning the rapid multiplication and increased violence 
of diseases since the flood which appears in the introduction is enough to shock any 
believer in definite material established natural science and when eugene came upon this in the 
outset it irritated him of course greatly why should anybody make such a silly statement 
as this everybody knew that there had never been a flood why quote a myth 
as a fact it irritated and from a critical point of view amused him then 
he came upon what he deemed to be a jumble of confusion in regard to 
matter and spirit the author talked of the evidences of the five physical senses as 
being worthless and yet was constantly referring to and using similes based upon those evidences 
to illustrate her spiritual meanings he threw the book down a number of times for 
the biblical references irritated him he did not believe in the bible the very word 
christianity was a sickening jest as sickening as it had been to the man in 
the church to say that the miracles of christ could be repeated today could not 
be serious still the man had testified wasn't that so a certain vein of sincerity 
running through it allthat profound evidence of faith and sympathy which are the characteristics of 
all sincere reformersappealed to him some little thoughts here and therea profound acceptance of the 
spiritual understanding of jesus which he himself accepted stayed with him one sentence or paragraph 
somehow stuck in his mind because he himself was of a metaphysical turn become conscious 
for a single moment that life and intelligence are purely spiritual neither in nor of 
matter and the body will then utter no complaints if suffering from a belief in 
sickness you will find yourself suddenly well sorrow is turned into joy when the body 
is controlled by spiritual life and love god is a spirit he recalled jesus as 
saying they that worship him must worship in spirit and in truth you will find 
yourself suddenly well thought eugene sorrow is turned into joy sorrow what kind of sorrow 
love sorrow this probably meant the end of earthly love that that too was mortal 
he read on discovering that scientists believed in the immaculate conception of the virgin mary 
which struck him as silly also that they believed in the ultimate abolition of marriage 
as representing a mortal illusion of selfcreation and perpetuation and of course the having of 
children through the agency of the sexes also the dematerialization of the bodyits chemicalization into 
its native spirituality wherein there can be neither sin sickness disease decay nor death were 
a part of their belief or understanding it seemed to him to be a wild 
claim and yet at the time because of his natural metaphysical turn it accorded with 
his sense of the mystery of life it should be remembered as a factor in 
this reading that eugene was particularly fitted by temperamentintrospective imaginative psychicaland by a momentarily despairing 
attitude in which any straw was worth grasping at which promised relief from sorrow despair 
and defeat to make a study of this apparently radical theory of human existence he 
had heard a great deal of christian science seeing its churches built its adherents multiplying 
particularly in new york and enthusiastically claiming freedom from every human ill idle without entertainment 
or diversion and intensely introspective it was natural that these curious statements should arrest him 
he was not unaware also from past reading and scientific speculation that carlyle had once 
said that matter itselfthe outer world of matter was either nothing or else a product 
due to man's mind carlyle's journal from froude's life of carlyle and that kant had 
held the whole universe to be something in the eye or mindneither more nor less 
than a thought marcus aurelius he recalled had said somewhere in his meditations that the 
soul of the universe was kind and merciful that it had no evil in it 
and was not harmed by evil this latter thought stuck in his mind as peculiar 
because it was so diametrically opposed to his own feelings that the universe the spirit 
of it that is was subtle cruel crafty and malicious he wondered how a man 
who could come to be emperor of rome could have thought otherwise christ's sermon on 
the mount had always appealed to him as the lovely speculations of an idealist who 
had no real knowledge of life yet he had always wondered why lay not up 
for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break 
through and steal had thrilled him as something so beautiful that it must be true 
for where your treasure is there will your heart be also keats had said beauty 
is truthtruth beauty and still another truth is what is and what is he had 
asked himself in answer to that beauty was his reply to himself for life at 
bottom in spite of all its teeming terrors was beautiful only those of a metaphysical 
or natural religious turn of mind would care to follow the slow process of attempted 
alteration which took place during the series of months which followed angela's departure for racine 
her return to new york at myrtle's solicitation the time she spent in the maternity 
hospital whither she was escorted on her arrival by eugene and after these are the 
deeps of being which only the more able intellectually essay but eugene wandered in them 
far and wide there were long talks with myrtle and bangsarguments upon all phases of 
mortal thought real and unreal with which angela's situation had nothing to do eugene frankly 
confessed that he did not love herthat he did not want to live with her 
he insisted that he could scarcely live without suzanne there was the taking up and 
reading or rereading of odd philosophic and religious volumes for he had nothing else to 
do he did not care at first to go and sit with angela sorry as 
he was for her he read or reread kent's history of the hebrews weiniger's sex 
and character carl snyder's the world machine muzzey's spiritual heroes johnston's translation of bhagavad ghita 
emerson's essay on the oversoul and huxley's science and hebrew tradition and science and christian 
tradition he learned from these things some curious facts which relate to religion which he 
had either not known before or forgotten ie that the jews were almost the only 
race or nation which developed a consecutive line of religious thinkers or prophets that their 
ideal was first and last a single god or divinity tribal at first but later 
on universal whose scope and significance were widened until he embraced the whole universewas in 
fact the universea governing principleone god however belief in whom his power to heal to 
build up and overthrow had never been relinquished the old testament was full of that 
was that the old prophets he learned to his astonishment were little more than whirling 
dervishes when they are first encountered historically working themselves up into wild transports and frenzies 
lying on the ground and writhing cutting themselves as the persian zealots do to this 
day in their feast of the tenth month and resorting to the most curious devices 
for nurturing their fanatic spirit but always setting forth something that was astonishingly spiritual and 
great they usually frequented the holy places and were to be distinguished by their wild 
looks and queer clothing isaiah eschewed clothing for three years is jeremiah appeared in the 
streets of the capital according to muzzey with a wooden yoke on his neck saying 
thus shalt juda's neck be bent under bondage to the babylonian jer ff zedekiah came 
to king ahab wearing horns of iron like a steer and saying thus shalt thou 
push the syrians kings the prophet was called mad because he acted like a madman 
elisha dashed in on the gruff captain jehu in his camp and broke a vial 
of oil on his head saying thus saith the lord god of israel i have 
made thee king over the people of the lord then he opened the door and 
fled somehow though these things seemed wild yet they accorded with eugene's sense of prophecy 
they were not cheap but greatwildly dramatic like the word of a lord god might 
be another thing that fascinated him was to find that the evolutionary hypothesis did not 
after all shut out a conception of a ruling ordaining divinity as he had supposed 
for he came across several things in the papers which now that he was thinking 
about this so keenly held him spellbound one was quoted from a biological work by 
a man named george m gould and read: life reaches control of physical forces by 
the cellmechanism and so far as we know by it solely from reading mrs eddy 
and arguing with bangs eugene was not prepared to admit this but he was fascinated 
to see how it led ultimately to an acknowledgment of an active divinity which shapes 
our ends no organic molecule shows any evidence of intellect design or purpose it is 
the product solely of mathematically determinate and invariable physical forces life becomes conscious of itself 
through specialized cellular activity and human personality therefore can only be a unity of greater 
differentiations of function a higher and fuller incarnation than the single cell incarnation life or 
god is in the cell and everywhere outside of it quite as active and more 
so perhaps eugene reserved mentally the cell's intelligence is his from reading mrs eddy eugene 
could not quite agree with this according to her it was an illusion the human 
personality is also at last himself and only himself if you wish to say 'biologos' 
or god instead of life i heartily agree and we are face to face with 
the sublime fact of biology the cell is god's instrument and mediator in materiality it 
is the mechanism of incarnation the word made flesh and dwelling among us the other 
was a quotation in a sunday newspaper from some man who appeared to be a 
working physicist of the timeedgar lucien larkin: with the discovery and recent perfection of the 
new ultraviolet light microscope and the companion apparatus the microphotographic camera with rapidly moving sensitive 
films it seems that the extreme limit of vision of the human eye has been 
reached inorganic and organic particles have been seen and these so minute that the smallest 
objects visible in the most powerful oldstyle instruments are as huge chunks in comparison an 
active microscopic universe as wonderful as the sidereal universe the stellar structure has been revealed 
this complexity actually exists but exploration has scarcely commenced within a hundred years devoted to 
this research the microuniverse may be partially understood laws of micromovements may be detected and 
published in textbooks like those of the gigantic universe suns and their concentric planets and 
moons i cannot look into these minute moving and living deeps without instantly believing that 
they are mentalevery motion is controlled by mind the longer i look at the amazing 
things the deeper is this conviction this microuniverse is rooted and grounded in a mental 
base positively and without hope of overthrow this assertion is madethe flying particles know where 
to go coarse particles those visible in oldtime microscopes when suspended in liquids were observed 
to be in rapid motion darting to all geometrical directions with high speed but the 
ultraviolet microscope reveals moving trillions of far smaller bodies and these rush on geometric lines 
and cutout angles with the most incredible speed specific for each kind and type what 
were the angles eugene asked himself who made them who or what arranged the geometric 
lines the divine mind of mrs eddy had this woman really found the truth he 
pondered this reading on and then one day in a paper he came upon this 
reflection in regard to the universe and its government by alfred russel wallace which interested 
him as a proof that there might be as jesus said and as mrs eddy 
contended a divine mind or central thought in which there was no evil intent but 
only good the quotation was: life is that power which from air and water and 
the substances dissolved therein builds up organized and highly complex structures possessing definite forms and 
functions these are presented in a continuous state of decay and repair by internal circulation 
of fluids and gases they reproduce their like go through various phases of youth maturity 
and age die and quickly decompose into their constituent elements they thus form continuous series 
of similar individuals and so long as external conditions render their existence possible seem to 
possess a potential immortality it is very necessary to presuppose some vast intelligence some pervading 
spirit to explain the guidance of the lower forces in accordance with the preordained system 
of evolution we see prevailing nothing less will do if however we go as far 
as this we must go further we have a perfect right on logical and scientific 
grounds to see in all the infinitely varied products of the animal and vegetable kingdoms 
which we alone can make use of a preparation for ourselves to assist in our 
mental development and to fit us for a progressively higher state of existence as spiritual 
beings it seems only logical to assume that the vast the infinite chasm between ourselves 
and the deity is to some extent occupied by an almost infinite series of grades 
of beings each successive grade having higher and higher powers in regard to the origination 
the development and the control of the universe there may have been a vast system 
of cooperation of such grades of beings from a very high grade of power and 
intelligence down to those unconscious or almost unconscious cell souls posited by haeckel i can 
imagine the infinite being foreseeing and determining the broad outlines of a universe he might 
for instance impress a sufficient number of his highest angels to create by their will 
power the primal universe of ether with all those inherent properties and forces necessary for 
what was to follow using this as a vehicle the next subordinate association of angels 
would so act upon the ether as to develop from it in suitable masses and 
at suitable distances the various elements of matter which under the influence of such laws 
and forces as gravitation heat and electricity would thenceforth begin to form those vast systems 
of nebulæ and suns which constitute our stellar universe then we may imagine these hosts 
of angels to whom a thousand years are as one day watching the development of 
this vast system of suns and planets until some one or more of them combined 
in itself all those conditions of size of elementary constitution of atmosphere of mass of 
water and requisite distance from its source of heat as to insure a stability of 
constitution and uniformity of temperature for a given minimum of millions of years or of 
ages as would be required for the full development of a life world from amoeba 
to man with a surplus of a few hundreds of millions for his adequate development 
we are led therefore to postulate a body of what we may term organizing spirits 
who would be charged with the duty of so influencing the myriads of cell souls 
as to carry out their part of the work with accuracy and certainty at successive 
stages of the development of the life world more and perhaps higher intelligences might be 
required to direct the main lines of variation in definite directions in accordance with the 
general design to be worked out and to guard against a break in the particular 
line which alone could lead ultimately to the production of the human form this speculative 
suggestion i venture to hope will appeal to some of my readers as the very 
best approximation we are now able to formulate as to the deeper the most fundamental 
causes of matter and force of life and consciousness and of man himself at his 
best already a little lower than the angels and like them destined to a permanent 
progressive existence in a world of spirit this very peculiar and apparently progressive statement in 
regard to the conclusion which naturalistic science had revealed in regard to the universe struck 
eugene as pretty fair confirmation of mrs eddy's contention that all was mind and its 
infinite variety and that the only difference between her and the british scientific naturalists was 
that they contended for an ordered hierarchy which could only rule and manifest itself according 
to its own ordered or selfimposed laws which they could perceive or detect whereas she 
contended for a governing spirit which was everywhere and would act through ordered laws and 
powers of its own arrangement god was a principle like a rule in mathematicstwo times 
two is four for instanceand was as manifest daily and hourly and momentarily in a 
hall bedroom as in the circling motions of suns and systems god was a principle 
he grasped that now a principle could be and was of course anywhere and everywhere 
at one and the same time one could not imagine a place for instance where 
two times two would not be four or where that rule would not be so 
likewise with the omnipotent omniscient omnipresent mind of god chapter xxvi the most dangerous thing 
to possess a man to the extent of dominating him is an idea it can 
and does ride him to destruction eugene's idea of the perfection of eighteen was one 
of the most dangerous things in his nature in a way combined with the inability 
of angela to command his interest and loyalty it had been his undoing up to 
this date a religious idea followed in a narrow sense would have diverted this other 
but it also might have destroyed him if he had been able to follow it 
fortunately the theory he was now interesting himself in was not a narrow dogmatic one 
in any sense but religion in its large aspects a comprehensive resumé and spiritual coordination 
of the metaphysical speculation of the time which was worthy of anyone's intelligent inquiry christian 
science as a cult or religion was shunned by current religions and religionists as something 
outré impossible uncannyas necromancy imagination hypnotism mesmerism spiritismeverything in short that it was not and 
little if anything that it really was mrs eddy had formulated or rather restated a 
fact that was to be found in the sacred writings of india in the hebrew 
testaments old and new in socrates marcus aurelius st augustine emerson and carlyle the one 
variation notable between her and the moderns was that her ruling unity was not malicious 
as eugene and many others fancied but helpful her unity was a unity of love 
god was everything but the father of evil which according to her was an illusionneither 
fact nor substancesound and fury signifying nothing it must be remembered that during all the 
time eugene was doing this painful and religious speculation he was living in the extreme 
northern portion of the city working desultorily at some paintings which he thought he might 
sell visiting angela occasionally safely hidden away in the maternity hospital at one hundred and 
tenth street thinking hourly and momentarily of suzanne and wondering if by any chance he 
should ever see her any more his mind had been so inflamed by the beauty 
and the disposition of this girl that he was really not normal any longer he 
needed some shock some catastrophe greater than any he had previously experienced to bring him 
to his senses the loss of his position had done something the loss of suzanne 
had only heightened his affection for her the condition of angela had given him pause 
for it was an interesting question what would become of her if she would only 
die he said to himself for we have the happy faculty of hating most joyously 
on this earth the thing we have wronged the most he could scarcely go and 
see her so obsessed was he with the idea that she was a handicap to 
his career the idea of her introducing a child into his life only made him 
savage now if she should die he would have the child to care for and 
suzanne because of it might never come to him his one idea at this time 
was not to be observed too much or rather not at all for he considered 
himself to be in great disfavor and only likely to do himself injury by a 
public appearancea fact which was more in his own mind than anywhere else if he 
had not believed it it would not have been true for this reason he had 
selected this quiet neighborhood where the line of current city traffic was as nothing for 
here he could brood in peace the family that he lived with knew nothing about 
him winter was setting in because of the cold and snow and high winds he 
was not likely to see many people hereaboutsparticularly those celebrities who had known him in 
the past there was a great deal of correspondence that followed him from his old 
address for his name had been used on many committees he was in who's who 
and he had many friends less distinguished than those whose companionship would have required the 
expenditure of much money who would have been glad to look him up he ignored 
all invitations however refused to indicate by return mail where he was for the present 
walked largely at night read painted or sat and brooded during the day he was 
thinking all the time of suzanne and how disastrously fate had trapped him apparently through 
her he was thinking that she might come back that she ought lovely hurtful pictures 
came to him of reencounters with her in which she would rush into his arms 
never to part from him any more angela in her room at the hospital received 
little thought from him she was there she was receiving expert medical attention he was 
paying all the bills her serious time had not yet really come myrtle was seeing 
her he caught glimpses of himself at times as a cruel hard intellect driving the 
most serviceable thing his life had known from him with blows but somehow it seemed 
justifiable angela was not suited to him why could she not live away from him 
christian science set aside marriage entirely as a human illusion conflicting with the indestructible unity 
of the individual with god why shouldn't she let him go he wrote poems to 
suzanne and read much poetry that he found in an old trunkful of books in 
the house where he was living he would read again and again the sonnet beginning 
when in disgrace with fortune and men's eyesthat cry out of a darkness that seemed 
to be like his own he bought a book of verse by yeats and seemed 
to hear his own voice saying of suzanne why should i blame her that she 
filled my days with misery he was not quite as bad as he was when 
he had broken down eight years before but he was very bad his mind was 
once more riveted upon the uncertainty of life its changes its follies he was studying 
those things only which deal with the abstrusities of nature and this began to breed 
again a morbid fear of life itself myrtle was greatly distressed about him she worried 
lest he might lose his mind why don't you go to see a practitioner eugene 
she begged of him one day you will get helpreally you will you think you 
won't but you will there is something about themi don't know what they are spiritually 
at rest you will feel better do go oh why do you bother me myrtle 
please don't i don't want to go i think there is something in the idea 
metaphysically speaking but why should i go to a practitioner god is as near me 
as he is anyone if there is a god myrtle wrung her hands and because 
she felt so badly more than anything else he finally decided to go there might 
be something hypnotic or physically contagious about these peoplesome old alchemy of the mortal body 
which could reach and soothe him he believed in hypnotism hypnotic suggestion etc he finally 
called up one practitioner an old lady highly recommended by myrtle and others who lived 
farther south on broadway somewhere in the neighborhood of myrtle's home mrs althea johns was 
her namea woman who had performed wonderful cures why should he eugene witla he asked 
himself as he took up the receiver why should he eugene witla exmanaging publisher of 
the united magazines corporation exartist in a way he felt that he was no longer 
an artist in the best sense be going to a woman in christian science to 
be healed of what gloom yes failure yes heartache yes his evil tendencies in regard 
to women such as the stranger who had sat beside him had testified to yes 
how strange and yet he was curious it interested him a little to speculate as 
to whether this could really be done could he be healed of failure could this 
pain of longing be made to cease did he want it to cease no certainly 
not he wanted suzanne myrtle's idea he knew was that somehow this treatment would reunite 
him and angela and make him forget suzanne but he knew that could not be 
he was going but he was going because he was unhappy and idle and aimless 
he was going because he really did not know what else to do the apartment 
of mrs johnsmrs althea johnswas in an apartment house of conventional design of which there 
were in new york hundreds upon hundreds at the time there was a spacious areaway 
between two wings of creamcolored pressed brick leading back to an entrance way which was 
protected by a handsome wroughtiron door on either side of which was placed an electric 
lamp support of handsome design holding lovely creamcolored globes shedding a soft lustre inside was 
the usual lobby elevator uniformed negro elevator man indifferent and impertinent and the telephone switchboard 
the building was seven storeys high eugene went one snowy blustery january night the great 
wet flakes were spinning in huge whirls and the streets were covered with a soft 
slushy carpet of snow he was interested as usual in spite of his gloom in 
the picture of beauty the world presentedthe city wrapped in a handsome mantle of white 
here were cars rumbling people hunched in great coats facing the driving wind he liked 
the snow the flakes this wonder of material living it eased his mind of his 
misery and made him think of painting again mrs johns was on the seventh floor 
eugene knocked and was admitted by a maid he was shown to a waiting room 
for he was a little ahead of his time and there were othershealthylooking men and 
women who did not appear to have an ache or painahead of him was not 
this a sign he thought as he sat down that this was something which dealt 
with imaginary ills then why had the man he had heard in the church beside 
him testified so forcibly and sincerely to his healing well he would wait and see 
he did not see what it could do for him now he had to work 
he sat there in one corner his hands folded and braced under his chin thinking 
the room was not artistic but rather nondescript the furniture cheap or rather tasteless in 
design didn't divine mind know any better than to present its representatives in such a 
guise as this could a person called to assist in representing the majesty of god 
on earth be left so unintelligent artistically as to live in a house like this 
surely this was a poor manifestation of divinity but mrs johns camea short stout homely 
woman gray wrinkled dowdy in her clothing a small wen on one side of her 
mouth a nose slightly too big to be pleasingall mortal deficiencies as to appearance highly 
emphasized and looking like an old print of mrs micawber that he had seen somewhere 
she had on a black skirt good as to material but shapeless commonplace and a 
dark bluegray waist her eye was clear and gray though he noticed and she had 
a pleasing smile this is mr witla i believe she said coming across the room 
to him for he had got into a corner near the window and speaking with 
an accent which sounded a little scotch i'm so glad to see you won't you 
come in she said giving him precedence over some others because of his appointment and 
recrossed the room preceding him down the hall to her practice room she stood to 
one side to take his hand as he passed he touched it gingerly so this 
was mrs johns he thought as he entered looking about him bangs and myrtle had 
insisted that she had performed wonderful curesor rather that divine mind had through her her 
hands were wrinkled her face old why didn't she make herself young if she could 
perform these wonderful cures why was this room so mussy it was actually stuffy with 
chromos and etchings of the christ and bible scenes on the walls a cheap red 
carpet or rug on the floor inartistic leathercovered chairs a table or desk too full 
of books a pale picture of mrs eddy and silly mottoes of which he was 
sick and tired hung here and there people were such hacks when it came to 
the art of living how could they pretend to a sense of divinity who knew 
nothing of life he was weary and the room here offended him mrs johns did 
besides her voice was slightly falsetto could she cure cancer and consumption and all other 
horrible human ills as myrtle insisted she had he didn't believe it he sat down 
wearily and yet contentiously in the chair she pointed out to him and stared at 
her while she quietly seated herself opposite him looking at him with kindly smiling eyes 
and now she said easily what does god's child think is the matter with him 
eugene stirred irritably god's child he thought what cant what right had he to claim 
to be a child of god what was the use of beginning that way it 
was silly so asinine why not ask plainly what was the matter with him still 
he answered: oh a number of things so many that i am pretty sure they 
can never be remedied as bad as that surely not it is good to know 
anyhow that nothing is impossible to god we can believe that anyhow can't we she 
replied smiling you believe in god or a ruling power don't you i don't know 
whether i do or not in the main i guess i do i'm sure i 
ought to yes i guess i do is he a malicious god to you i 
have always thought so he replied thinking of angela mortal mind mortal mind she asseverated 
to herself what delusions will it not harbor and then to him: one has to 
be cured almost against one's will to know that god is a god of love 
so you believe you are sinful do you and that he is malicious it is 
not necessary that you should tell me how we are all alike in the mortal 
state i would like to call your attention to isaiah's words 'though your sins be 
as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson 
they shall be as wool' eugene had not heard this quotation for years it was 
only a dim thing in his memory it flashed out simply now and appealed as 
had all these hebraic bursts of prophetic imagery in the past mrs johns for all 
her wen and her big nose and dowdy clothes was a little better for having 
been able to quote this so aptly it raised her in his estimation it showed 
a vigorous mind at least a tactful mind can you cure sorrow he asked grimly 
and with a touch of sarcasm in his voice can you cure heartache or fear 
i can do nothing of myself she said perceiving his mood all things are possible 
to god however if you believe in a supreme intelligence he will cure you st 
paul says 'i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me' have you read 
mrs eddy's book most of it i'm still reading it do you understand it no 
not quite it seems a bundle of contradictions to me to those who are first 
coming into science it nearly always seems so but don't let that worry you you 
would like to be cured of your troubles st paul says 'for the wisdom of 
this world is foolishness with god' 'the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wisethat they 
are vain' do not think of me as a woman or as having had anything 
to do with this i would rather have you think of me as st paul 
describes anyone who works for truth'now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god 
did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be ye reconciled to 
god' you know your bible don't you said eugene it is the only knowledge i 
have she replied there followed one of those peculiar religious demonstrations so common in christian 
scienceso peculiar to the uninitiatedin which she asked eugene to fix his mind in meditation 
on the lord's prayer never mind if it seems pointless to you now you have 
come here seeking aid you are god's perfect image and likeness he will not send 
you away emptyhanded let me read you first though this one psalm which i think 
is always so helpful to the beginner she opened her bible which was on the 
table near her and began: he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most 
high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord 
he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust surely 
he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence 
he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust: his 
truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the 
terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day nor for the pestilence 
that walketh in the darkness nor for destruction that wasteth at noonday a thousand shall 
fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not 
come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of 
the wicked because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most 
high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh 
thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in 
all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy 
foot against a stone thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder the young 
lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under foot because he hath set his love 
upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he 
hath known my name he shall call upon me and i will answer him: i 
will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long 
life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation during this most exquisite pronunciamento 
of divine favor eugene was sitting with his eyes closed his thoughts wandering over all 
his recent ills for the first time in years he was trying to fix his 
mind upon an allwise omnipresent omnipotent generosity it was hard and he could not reconcile 
the beauty of this expression of divine favor with the nature of the world as 
he knew it what was the use of saying they shall bear thee up in 
their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone when he had seen angela 
and himself suffering so much recently wasn't he dwelling in the secret place of the 
most high when he was alive how could one get out of it still because 
he hath set his love on metherefore will i deliver him was that the answer 
was angela's love set on him was his own might not all their woes have 
sprung from that he shall call upon me and i shall answer i will deliver 
him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him had he ever really called 
on him had angela hadn't they been left in the slough of their own despond 
still angela was not suited to him why did not god straighten that out he 
didn't want to live with her he wandered through this philosophically critically until mrs johns 
stopped what he asked himself if in spite of all his doubts this seeming clamor 
and reality and pain and care were an illusion angela was suffering so were many 
other people how could this thing be true did not these facts exclude the possibility 
of illusion could they possibly be a part of it now we are going to 
try to realize that we are god's perfect children she said stopping and looking at 
him we think we are so big and strong and real we are real enough 
but only as a thought in godthat is all no harm can happen to us 
thereno evil can come nigh us for god is infinite all power all life truth 
love over all and all she closed her eyes and began as she said to 
try to realize for him the perfectness of his spirit in god eugene sat there 
trying to think of the lord's prayer but in reality thinking of the room the 
cheap prints the homely furniture her ugliness the curiousness of his being there he eugene 
witla being prayed for what would angela think why was this woman old if spirit 
could do all these other things why didn't she make herself beautiful what was it 
she was doing now was this hypnotism mesmerism she was practicing he remembered where mrs 
eddy had especially said that these were not to be practicedcould not be in science 
no she was no doubt sincere she looked ittalked it she believed in this beneficent 
spirit would it aid as the psalm said would it heal this ache would it 
make him not want suzanne ever any more perhaps that was evil yes no doubt 
it was still perhaps he had better fix his mind on the lord's prayer divinity 
could aid him if it would certainly it could no doubt of it there was 
nothing impossible to this vast force ruling the universe look at the telephone wireless telegraphy 
how about the stars and sun he shall give his angels charge over thee now 
said mrs johns after some fifteen minutes of silent meditation had passed and she opened 
her eyes smilinglywe are going to see whether we are not going to be better 
we are going to feel better because we are going to do better and because 
we are going to realize that nothing can hurt an idea in god all the 
rest is illusions it cannot hold us for it is not real think goodgodand you 
are good think evil and you are evil but it has no reality outside your 
own thought remember that she talked to him as though he was a little child 
he went out into the snowy night where the wind was whirling the snow in 
picturesque whirls buttoning his coat about him the cars were running up broadway as usual 
taxicabs were scuttling by there were people forging their way through the snow that everpresent 
company of a great city there were arc lights burning clearly blue through the flying 
flakes he wondered as he walked whether this would do him any good mrs eddy 
insisted that all these were unreal he thoughtthat mortal mind had evolved something which was 
not in accord with spiritmortal mind a liar and the father of it he recalled 
that quotation could it be so was evil unreal was misery only a belief could 
he come out of his sense of fear and shame and once more face the 
world he boarded a car to go north at kingsbridge he made his way thoughtfully 
to his room how could life ever be restored to him as it had been 
he was really forty years of age he sat down in his chair near his 
lamp and took up his book science and health and opened it aimlessly then he 
thought for curiosity's sake he would see where he had opened itwhat the particular page 
or paragraph his eye fell on had to say to him he was still intensely 
superstitious he looked and here was this paragraph growing under his eyes: when mortal man 
blends his thoughts of existence with the spiritual and works only as god works he 
will no longer grope in the dark and cling to earth because he has not 
tasted heaven carnal beliefs defraud us they make man an involuntary hypocriteproducing evil when he 
would create good forming deformity when he would outline grace and beauty injuring those whom 
he would bless he becomes a general miscreator who believes he is a semigod his 
touch turns hope to dust the dust we all have trod he might say in 
bible language 'the good that i would i do not but evil which i would 
not i do' he closed the book and meditated he wished he might realize this 
thing if this were so still he did not want to become a religionista religious 
enthusiast how silly they were he picked up his daily paperthe evening postand there on 
an inside page quoted in an obscure corner was a passage from a poem by 
the late francis thompson entitled the hound of heaven it began: i fled him down 
the nights and down the days i fled him down the arches of the years 
the ending moved him strangely: still with unhurrying chase and unperturbèd face deliberate speed majestic 
instancy came on the following feet and a voice above their beat naught shelters thee 
who wilt not shelter me did this man really believe this was it so he 
turned back to his book and read on and by degrees he came half to 
believe that sin and evil and sickness might possibly be illusionsthat they could be cured 
by aligning one's self intellectually and spiritually with this divine principle he wasn't sure this 
terrible sense of wrong could he give up suzanne did he want to no he 
got up and went to the window and looked out the snow was still blowing 
give her up give her up and angela in such a precarious condition what a 
devil of a hole he was in anyway well he would go and see her 
in the morning he would at least be kind he would see her through this 
thing he lay down and tried to sleep but somehow sleep never came to him 
right any more he was too wearied too distressed too wrought up [s]till he slept 
a little and that was all he could hope for in these days chapter xxvii 
it was while he was in this state some two months later that the great 
event so far as angela was concerned came about and in it of necessity he 
was compelled to take part angela was in her room cosily and hygienically furnished overlooking 
the cathedral grounds at morningside heights and speculating hourly what her fate was to be 
she had never wholly recovered from the severe attack of rheumatism which she had endured 
the preceding summer and because of her worries since in her present condition was pale 
and weak though she was not ill the head visiting obstetrical surgeon dr lambert a 
lean gray man of sixtyfive years of age with grizzled cheeks whose curly gray hair 
wide humped nose and keen gray eyes told of the energy and insight and ability 
that had placed him where he was took a slight passing fancy to her for 
she seemed to him one of those plain patient little women whose lives are laid 
in sacrificial lines he liked her brisk practical cheery disposition in the face of her 
condition which was serious and which was so noticeable to strangers angela had naturally a 
bright cheery face when she was not depressed or quarrelsome it was the outward sign 
of her ability to say witty and clever things and she had never lost the 
desire to have things done efficiently and intelligently about her wherever she was the nurse 
miss de sale a solid phlegmatic person of thirtyfive admired her spunk and courage and 
took a great fancy to her also because she was lightsome buoyant and hopeful in 
the face of what was really a very serious situation the general impression of the 
head operating surgeon the house surgeon and the nurse was that her heart was weak 
and that her kidneys might be affected by her condition angela had somehow concluded after 
talks with myrtle that christian science as demonstrated by its practitioners might help her through 
this crisis though she had no real faith in it eugene would come round she 
thought also for myrtle was having him treated absently and he was trying to read 
the book she said there would be a reconciliation between them when the baby camebecausebecause 
well because children were so winning eugene was really not hardheartedhe was just infatuated he 
had been ensnared by a siren he would get over it miss de sale let 
her hair down in braids gretchen style and fastened great pink bows of ribbon in 
them as her condition became more involved only the lightest morning gowns were given hersoft 
comfortable things in which she sat about speculating practically about the future she had changed 
from a lean shapeliness to a swollen somewhat uncomely object but she made the best 
of a bad situation eugene saw her and felt sorry it was the end of 
winter now with snow blowing gaily or fiercely about the windows and the park grounds 
opposite were snowwhite she could see the leafless line of sentinel poplars that bordered the 
upper edges of morningside she was calm patient hopeful while the old obstetrician shook his 
head gravely to the house surgeon we shall have to be very careful i shall 
take charge of the actual birth myself see if you can't build up her strength 
we can only hope that the head is small angela's littleness and courage appealed to 
him for once in a great many cases he really felt sorry the house surgeon 
did as directed angela was given specially prepared food and drink she was fed frequently 
she was made to keep perfectly quiet her heart the house surgeon reported to his 
superior i don't like that it's weak and irregular i think there's a slight lesion 
we can only hope for the best said the other solemnly we'll try and do 
without ether eugene in his peculiar mental state was not capable of realizing the pathos 
of all this he was alienated temperamentally and emotionally thinking that he cared for his 
wife dearly the nurse and the house surgeon were for not warning him they did 
not want to frighten him he asked several times whether he could be present during 
the delivery but they stated that it would be dangerous and trying the nurse asked 
angela if she had not better advise him to stay away angela did but eugene 
felt that in spite of his alienation she needed him besides he was curious he 
thought angela would stand it better if he were near and now that the ordeal 
was drawing nigh he was beginning to understand how desperate it might be and to 
think it was only fair that he should assist her some of the old pathetic 
charm of her littleness was coming back to him she might not live she would 
have to suffer much she had meant no real evil to himonly to hold him 
oh the bitterness and the pathos of this welter of earthly emotions why should they 
be so tangled the time drew very near and angela was beginning to suffer severe 
pains those wonderful processes of the allmother which bind the coming life in a cradle 
of muscles and ligaments were practically completed and were now relaxing their tendencies in one 
direction to enforce them in another angela suffered at times severely from straining ligaments her 
hands were clenched desperately her face would become deathly pale she would cry eugene was 
with her on a number of these occasions and it drove home to his consciousness 
the subtlety and terror of this great scheme of reproduction which took all women to 
the door of the grave in order that this mortal scheme of things might be 
continued he began to think that there might be something in the assertion of the 
christian science leaders that it was a lie and an illusion a terrible fitful fever 
outside the rational consciousness of god he went to the library one day and got 
down a book on obstetrics which covered the principles and practice of surgical delivery he 
saw there scores of pictures drawn very carefully of the child in various positions in 
the womball the strange peculiar flowerlike positions it could take folded in upon itself like 
a little halfformed petal the pictures were attractive some of them beautiful practical as they 
were they appealed to his fancy they showed the coming baby perfect but so small 
its head now in one position now in another its little arms twisted about in 
odd places but always delightfully suggestively appealing from reading here and there in the volume 
he learned that the great difficulty was the headthe delivery of that it appeared that 
no other difficulty really confronted the obstetrician how was that to be got out if 
the head were large the mother old the walls of the peritoneal cavity tight or 
hard a natural delivery might be impossible there were whole chapters on craniotomy cephalotripsy which 
in plain english means crushing the head with an instrument one chapter was devoted to 
the cæsarian operation with a description of its tremendous difficulties and a long disquisition on 
the ethics of killing the child to save the mother or the mother to save 
the child with their relative values to society indicated think of ita surgeon sitting in 
the seat of judge and executioner at the critical moment ah life with its petty 
laws did not extend here here we came back to the conscience of man which 
mrs eddy maintained was a reflection of immanent mind if god were good he would 
speak through thathe was speaking through it this surgeon referred to that inmost consciousness of 
supreme moral law which alone could guide the practitioner in this dreadful hour then he 
told of what implements were necessary how many assistants two how many nurses four the 
kinds of bandages needles silk and catgut thread knives clamp dilators rubber gloves he showed 
how the cut was to be madewhen where eugene closed the book frightened he got 
up and walked out in the air a desire to hurry up to angela impelling 
him she was weak he knew that she had complained of her heart her muscles 
were probably set supposing these problems any one of them should come in connection with 
her he did not wish her to die he had said he hadyes but he 
did not want to be a murderer no no angela had been good to him 
she had worked for him why god damn it she had actually suffered for him 
in times past he had treated her badly very badly and now in her pathetic 
little way she had put herself in this terrific position it was her fault to 
be sure it was she had been trying as she always had to hold him 
against his will but then could he really blame her it wasn't a crime for 
her to want him to love her they were just mismated he had tried to 
be kind in marrying her and he hadn't been kind at all it had merely 
produced unrest dissatisfaction unhappiness for him and for her and now thisthis danger of death 
through pain a weak heart defective kidneys a cæsarian operation why she couldn't stand anything 
like that there was no use talking about it she wasn't strong enoughshe was too 
old he thought of christian science practitioners of how they might save herof some eminent 
surgeon who would know how without the knife how how if these christian scientists could 
only think her through a thing like thishe wouldn't be sorry he would be glad 
for her sake if not his own he might give up suzannehe mighthe might oh 
why should that thought intrude on him now when he reached the hospital it was 
three o'clock in the afternoon and he had been there for a little while in 
the morning when she was comparatively all right she was much worse the straining pains 
in her side which she had complained of were worse and her face was alternately 
flushed and pale sometimes convulsed a little myrtle was there talking with her and eugene 
stood about nervously wondering what he should dowhat he could do angela saw his worry 
in spite of her own condition she was sorry for him she knew that this 
would cause him pain for he was not hardhearted and it was his first sign 
of relenting she smiled at him thinking that maybe he would come round and change 
his attitude entirely myrtle kept reassuring her that all would be well with her the 
nurse said to her and to the house doctor who came in a young man 
of twentyeight with keen quizzical eyes whose sandy hair and ruddy complexion bespoke a fighting 
disposition that she was doing nicely no bearing down pains he asked smiling at angela 
his even white teeth showing in two gleaming rows i don't know what kind they 
are doctor she replied i've had all kinds you'll know them fast enough he replied 
mock cheerfully they're not like any other kind he went away and eugene followed him 
how is she doing he asked when they were out in the hall well enough 
considering she's not very strong you know i have an idea she is going to 
be all right dr lambert will be here in a little while you had better 
talk to him the house surgeon did not want to lie he thought eugene ought 
to be told dr lambert was of the same opinion but he wanted to wait 
until the last until he could judge approximately correctly he came at five when it 
was already dark outside and looked at angela with his grave kindly eyes he felt 
her pulse listened to her heart with his stethoscope do you think i shall be 
all right doctor asked angela faintly to be sure to be sure he replied softly 
little woman big courage he smoothed her hand he walked out and eugene followed him 
well doctor he said for the first time for months eugene was thinking of something 
besides his lost fortune and suzanne i think it advisable to tell you mr witla 
said the old surgeon that your wife is in a serious condition i don't want 
to alarm you unnecessarilyit may all come out very satisfactorily i have no positive reason 
to be sure that it will not she is pretty old to have a child 
her muscles are set the principal thing we have to fear in her case is 
some untoward complication with her kidneys there is always difficulty in the delivery of the 
head in women of her age it may be necessary to sacrifice the child i 
can't be sure the cæsarian operation is something i never care to think about it 
is rarely used and it isn't always successful every care that can be taken will 
be taken i should like to have you understand the conditions your consent will be 
asked before any serious steps are taken your decision will have to be quick however 
when the time comes i can tell you now doctor what my decision will be 
said eugene realizing fully the gravity of the situation for the time being his old 
force and dignity were restored save her life if you can by any means that 
you can i have no other wish thanks said the surgeon we will do the 
best we can there were hours after that when eugene sitting by angela saw her 
endure pain which he never dreamed it was possible for any human being to endure 
he saw her draw herself up rigid time and again the color leaving her face 
the perspiration breaking out on her forehead only to relax and flush and groan without 
really crying out he saw strange to relate that she was no baby like himself 
whimpering over every little ill but a representative of some great creative force which gave 
her power at once to suffer greatly and to endure greatly she could not smile 
any more that was not possible she was in a welter of suffering unbroken astonishing 
myrtle had gone home to her dinner but promised to return later miss de sale 
came bringing another nurse and while eugene was out of the room angela was prepared 
for the final ordeal she was arrayed in the usual open back hospital slip and 
white linen leggings under doctor lambert's orders an operating table was got ready in the 
operating room on the top floor and a wheel table stationed outside the door ready 
to remove her if necessary he had left word that at the first evidence of 
the genuine childbearing pain which the nurse understood so well he was to be called 
the house surgeon was to be in immediate charge of the case eugene wondered in 
this final hour at the mechanical practical businesslike manner in which all these tragediesthe hospital 
was full of womenwere taken miss de sale went about her duties calm smiling changing 
the pillows occasionally for angela straightening the disordered bedclothes adjusting the window curtains fixing her 
own lace cap or apron before the mirror which was attached to the dresser or 
before the one that was set in the closet door and doing other little things 
without number she took no interest in eugene's tense attitude or myrtle's when she was 
there but went in and out talking jesting with other nurses doing whatever she had 
to do quite undisturbed isn't there anything that can be done to relieve her of 
this pain eugene asked wearily at one point his own nerves were torn she can't 
stand anything like that she hasn't the strength she shook her head placidly there isn't 
a thing that anyone can do we can't give her an opiate it stops the 
process she just has to bear it all women do all women thought eugene good 
god did all women go through a siege like this every time a child was 
born there were two billion people on the earth now had there been two billion 
such scenes had he come this wayangela every child what a terrible mistake she had 
madeso unnecessary so foolish it was too late now though to speculate concerning this she 
was suffering she was agonizing the house surgeon came back after a time to look 
at her condition but was not at all alarmed apparently he nodded his head rather 
reassuringly to miss de sale who stood beside him i think she's doing all right 
he said i think so too she replied eugene wondered how they could say this 
she was suffering horribly i'm going into ward a for an hour said the doctor 
if any change comes you can get me there what change could come asked eugene 
of himself any worse than had already appeared he was thinking of the drawings though 
he had seen in the bookwondering if angela would have to be assisted in some 
of the grim mechanical ways indicated there they illustrated to him the deadly possibilities of 
what might follow about midnight the expected change which eugene in agonized sympathy was awaiting 
arrived myrtle had not returned she had been waiting to hear from eugene although angela 
had been groaning before pulling herself tense at times twisting in an aimless unhappy fashion 
now she seemed to spring up and fall as though she had fainted a shriek 
accompanied the movement and then another and another he rushed to the door but the 
nurse was there to meet him it's here she said quietly she went to a 
phone outside and called for dr willets a second nurse from some other room came 
in and stood beside her in spite of the knotted cords on angela's face the 
swollen veins the purple hue they were calm eugene could scarcely believe it but he 
made an intense effort to appear calm himself so this was childbirth in a few 
moments dr willets came in he also was calm business like energetic he was dressed 
in a black suit and white linen jacket but took that off leaving the room 
as he did so and returned with his sleeves rolled up and his body incased 
in a long white apron such as eugene had seen butchers wear he went over 
to angela and began working with her saying something to the nurse beside him which 
eugene did not hear he could not lookhe dared not at first at the fourth 
or fifth convulsive shriek a second doctor came in a young man of willets' age 
and dressed as he was who also took his place beside him eugene had never 
seen him before is it a case of forceps he asked i can't tell said 
the other dr lambert is handling this personally he ought to be here by now 
there was a step in the hall and the senior physician or obstetrician had entered 
in the lower hall he had removed his great coat and fur gloves he was 
dressed in his street clothes but after looking at angela feeling her heart and temples 
he went out and changed his coat for an apron like the others his sleeves 
were rolled up but he did not immediately do anything but watch the house surgeon 
whose hands were bloody can't they give her chloroform asked eugene to whom no one 
was paying any attention of miss de sale she scarcely heard but shook her head 
she was busy dancing attendance on her very far removed superiors the physicians i would 
advise you to leave the room said dr lambert to eugene coming over near him 
you can do nothing here you will be of no assistance whatsoever you may be 
in the way eugene left but it was only to pace agonizedly up and down 
the hall he thought of all the things that had passed between him and angelathe 
yearsthe struggles all at once he thought of myrtle and decided to call her upshe 
wanted to be there then he decided for the moment he would not she could 
do nothing then he thought of the christian science practitioner myrtle could get her to 
give angela absent treatment anything anythingit was a shame that she should suffer so myrtle 
he said nervously over the phone when he reached her this is eugene angela is 
suffering terribly the birth is on can't you get mrs johns to help her it's 
terrible certainly eugene i'll come right down don't worry he hung up the receiver and 
walked up and down the hall again he could hear mumbled voiceshe could hear muffled 
screams a nurse not miss de sale came out and wheeled in the operating table 
are they going to operate he asked feverishly i'm mr witla i don't think so 
i don't know dr lambert wants her to be taken to the operating room in 
case it is necessary they wheeled her out after a few moments and on to 
the elevator which led to the floor above her face was slightly covered while she 
was being so transferred and those who were around prevented him from seeing just how 
it was with her but because of her stillness he wondered and the nurse said 
that a very slight temporary opiate had been administerednot enough to affect the operation if 
it were found necessary eugene stood by dumbly terrified he stood in the hall outside 
the operating room half afraid to enter the head surgeon's warning came back to him 
and anyhow what good could he do he walked far down the dimlit length of 
the hall before him wondering and looked out on a space where was nothing but 
snow in the distance a long lighted train was winding about a high trestle like 
a golden serpent there were automobiles honking and pedestrians laboring along in the snow what 
a tangle life was he thought what a pity here a little while ago he 
wanted angela to die and nowgod almighty that was her voice groaning he would be 
punished for his evil thoughtsyes he would his sins all these terrible deeds would be 
coming home to him they were coming home to him now what a tragedy his 
career was what a failure hot tears welled up into his eyes his lower lip 
trembled not for himself but for angela he was so sorry all at once he 
shut it all back no by god he wouldn't cry what good were tears it 
was for angela his pain was and tears would not help her now thoughts of 
suzanne came to himmrs dale colfax but he shut them out if they could see 
him now then another muffled scream and he walked quickly back he couldn't stand this 
he didn't go in however instead he listened intently hearing something which sounded like gurgling 
choking breathing was that angela the low forcepsit was dr lambert's voice the high forceps 
it was his voice again something clinked like metal in a bowl it can't be 
done this way i'm afraid it was dr lambert's voice again we'll have to operate 
i hate to do it too a nurse came out to see if eugene were 
near you had better go down into the waiting room mr witla she cautioned they'll 
be bringing her out pretty soon it won't be long now no he said all 
at once i want to see for myself he walked into the room where angela 
was now lying on the operating table in the centre of the room a sixglobed 
electrolier blazed close overhead at her head was dr willets administering the anæsthetic on the 
right side was dr lambert his hands encased in rubber gloves bloody totally unconscious of 
eugene holding a scalpel one of the two nurses was near angela's feet officiating at 
a little table of knives bowls water sponges bandages on the left of the table 
was miss de sale her hands were arranging some cloths at the side of angela's 
body at her side opposite dr lambert was another surgeon whom eugene did not know 
angela was breathing stertorously she appeared to be unconscious her face was covered with cloths 
and a rubber mouth piece or cone eugene cut his palms with his nails so 
they have to operate after all he thought she is as bad as that the 
cæsarian operation then they couldn't even get the child from her by killing it seventyfive 
per cent of the cases recorded were successful so the book said but how many 
cases were not recorded was dr lambert a great surgeon could angela stand etherwith her 
weak heart he stood there looking at this wonderful picture while dr lambert quickly washed 
his hands he saw him take a small gleaming steel knifebright as polished silver the 
old man's hands were encased in rubber gloves which looked bluish white under the light 
angela's exposed flesh was the color of a candle he bent over her keep her 
breathing normal if you can he said to the young doctor if she wakes give 
her ether doctor you'd better look after the arteries he cut softly a little cut 
just below the centre of the abdomen apparently and eugene saw little trickling streams of 
blood spring where his blade touched it did not seem a great cut a nurse 
was sponging away the blood as fast as it flowed as he cut again the 
membrane that underlies the muscles of the abdomen and protects the intestines seemed to spring 
into view i don't want to cut too much said the surgeon calmlyalmost as though 
he were talking to himself these intestines are apt to become unmanageable if you just 
lift up the ends doctor that's right the sponge miss wood now if we can 
just cut here enoughhe was cutting again like an honest carpenter or cabinet worker he 
dropped the knife he held into miss wood's bowl of water he reached into the 
bleeding wound constantly sponged by the nurse exposing something what was that eugene's heart jerked 
he was reaching down now in there with his middle fingerhis fore and middle fingers 
afterwards and saying i don't find the leg let's see ah yes here we have 
it can i move the head a little for you doctor it was the young 
doctor at his left talking careful careful it's bent under in the region of the 
coccyx i have it now though slowly doctor look out for the placenta something was 
coming up out of this horrible cavity which was trickling with blood from the cut 
it was queer a little foot a leg a body a head as god is 
my judge said eugene to himself his eyes brimming again the placenta doctor look after 
the peritoneum miss wood it's alive all right how is her pulse miss de sale 
a little weak doctor use less ether there now we have it we'll put that 
back sponge we'll have to sew this afterwards willets i won't trust this to heal 
alone some surgeons think it will but i mistrust her recuperative power three or four 
stitches anyhow they were working like carpenters cabinet workers electricians angela might have been a 
lay figure for all they seemed to care and yet there was a tenseness here 
a great hurry through slow sure motion the less haste the more speed popped into 
eugene's mindthe old saw he stared as if this were all a dreama nightmare it 
might have been a great picture like rembrandt's the night watch one young doctor the 
one he did not know was holding aloft a purple object by the foot it 
might have been a skinned rabbit but eugene's horrified eyes realized that it was his 
childangela's childthe thing all this horrible struggle and suffering was about it was discolored impossible 
a myth a monster he could scarcely believe his eyes and yet the doctor was 
striking it on the back with his hand looking at it curiously at the same 
moment came a faint crynot a cry eitheronly a faint queer sound she's awfully little 
but i guess she'll make out it was dr willets talking of the baby angela's 
baby now the nurse had it that was angela's flesh they had been cutting that 
was angela's wound they were sewing this wasn't life it was a nightmare he was 
insane and being bedeviled by spirits now doctor i guess that will keep the blankets 
miss de sale you can take her away they were doing lots of things to 
angela fastening bandages about her removing the cone from her mouth changing her position back 
to one of lying flat preparing to bathe her moving her to the rolling table 
wheeling her out while she moaned unconscious under ether eugene could scarcely stand the sickening 
stertorous breathing it was such a strange sound to come from heras if her unconscious 
soul were crying and the child was crying too healthily oh god what a life 
what a life he thought to think that things should have to come this way 
death incisions unconsciousness pain could she live would she and now he was a father 
he turned and there was the nurse holding this littlest girl on a white gauze 
blanket or cushion she was doing something to itrubbing oil on it it was a 
pink child now like any other baby that isn't so bad is it she asked 
consolingly she wanted to restore eugene to a sense of the commonplace he was so 
distracted looking eugene stared at it a strange feeling came over him something went up 
and down his body from head to toe doing something to him it was a 
nervous titillating pinching feeling he touched the child he looked at its hands its face 
it looked like angela yes it did it was his child it was hers would 
she live would he do better oh god to have this thrust at him now 
and yet it was his child how could he poor little thing if angela diedif 
angela died he would have this and nothing else this little girl out of all 
her long dramatic struggle if she died came this to do what to him to 
guide to strengthen to change he could not say only somehow in spite of himself 
it was beginning to appeal to him it was the child of a storm and 
angela so near him nowwould she ever live to see it there she was unconscious 
numb horribly cut dr lambert was taking a last look at her before leaving do 
you think she will live doctor he asked the great surgeon feverishly the latter looked 
grave i can't say i can't say her strength isn't all that it ought to 
be her heart and kidneys make a bad combination however it was a last chance 
we had to take it i'm sorry i'm glad we were able to save the 
child the nurse will give her the best of care he went out into his 
practical world as a laborer leaves his work so may we all eugene went over 
and stood by angela he was tremendously sorry for the long years of mistrust that 
had brought this about he was ashamed of himself of lifeof its strange tangles she 
was so little so pale so worn yes he had done this he had brought 
her here by his lying his instability his uncertain temperament it was fairly murder from 
one point of view and up to this last hour he had scarcely relented but 
life had done things to him too now now oh hell oh god damn if 
she would only recover he would try and do better yes he would it sounded 
so silly coming from him but he would try love wasn't worth the agony it 
cost let it go let it go he could live truly there were hierarchies and 
powers as alfred russel wallace pointed out there was a god somewhere he was on 
his throne these large dark immutable forces they were not for nothing if she would 
only not die he would tryhe would behave he would he would he gazed at 
her but she looked so weak so pale now he did not think she could 
come round don't you want to come home with me eugene said myrtle who had 
come back some time before at his elbow we can't do anything here now the 
nurse says she may not become conscious for several hours the baby is all right 
in their care the baby the baby he had forgotten it forgotten myrtle he was 
thinking of the long dark tragedy of his lifethe miasma of it yes he said 
wearily it was nearly morning he went out and got into a taxi and went 
to his sister's home but in spite of his weariness he could scarcely sleep he 
rolled feverishly in the morning he was up again early anxious to go back and 
see how angela wasand the child chapter xxviii the trouble with angela's system in addition 
to a weak heart was that it was complicated at the time of her delivery 
by that peculiar manifestation of nervous distortion or convulsions known as eclampsia once in every 
five hundred cases or at least such was the statistical calculation at the time some 
such malady occurred to reduce the number of the newborn in every two such terminations 
one mother also died no matter what the anticipatory preparations were on the part of 
the most skilled surgeons though not caused by it was diagnosed by certain kidney changes 
what eugene had been spared while he was out in the hall was the sight 
of angela staring her mouth pulled to one side in a horrible grimace her body 
bent back canoe shape the arms flexed the fingers and thumbs bending over each other 
to and fro in and out slowly not unlike a mechanical figure that is running 
down stupor and unconsciousness had immediately followed and unless the child had been immediately brought 
into the world and the womb emptied she and it would have died a horrible 
death as it was she had no real strength to fight her way back to 
life and health a christian science practitioner was trying to realize her identity with good 
for her but she had no faith before and no consciousness now she came to 
long enough to vomit terribly and then sank into a fever in it she talked 
of eugene she was in blackwood evidently and wanted him to come back to her 
he held her hand and cried for he knew that there was never any recompense 
for that pain what a dog he had been he bit his lip and stared 
out of the window once he said: oh i'm no damned good i should have 
died that whole day passed without consciousness and most of the night at two in 
the morning angela woke and asked to see the baby the nurse brought it eugene 
held her hand it was put down beside her and she cried for joy but 
it was a weak soundless cry eugene cried also it's a girl isn't it she 
asked yes said eugene and then after a pause angela i want to tell you 
something i'm so sorry i'm ashamed i want you to get well i'll do better 
really i will at the same time he was wondering almost subconsciously whether he would 
or no wouldn't it be all the same if she were really wellor worse she 
caressed his hand don't cry she said i'll be all right i'm going to get 
well we'll both do better it's as much my fault as yours i've been too 
hard she worked at his fingers but he only choked his vocal cords hurt him 
i'm so sorry i'm so sorry he finally managed to say the child was taken 
away after a little while and angela was feverish again she grew very weak so 
weak that although she was conscious later she could not speak she tried to make 
some signs eugene the nurse myrtle understood the baby it was brought and held up 
before her she smiled a weak yearning smile and looked at eugene i'll take care 
of her he said bending over her he swore a great oath to himself he 
would be decenthe would be clean henceforth and for ever the child was put beside 
her for a little while but she could not move she sank steadily and died 
eugene sat by the bed holding his head in his hands so he had his 
wish she was really dead now he had been taught what it was to fly 
in the face of conscience instinct immutable law he sat there an hour while myrtle 
begged him to come away please eugene she said please no no he replied where 
shall i go i am well enough here after a time he did go however 
wondering how he would adjust his life from now on who would take care of 
of angela came the name to his mind yes he would call her angela he 
had heard someone say she was going to have pale yellow hair the rest of 
this story is a record of philosophic doubt and speculation and a gradual return to 
normality his kind of normalitythe artistic normality of which he was capable he wouldhe thoughtnever 
again be the maundering sentimentalist and enthusiast imagining perfection in every beautiful woman that he 
saw yet there was a period when had suzanne returned suddenly all would have been 
as before between them and even more so despite his tremulousness of spirit his speculative 
interest in christian science as a way out possibly his sense of brutality almost murder 
in the case of angelafor the old attraction still gnawed at his vitals although he 
had angela junior now to look after and in a way to divert hima child 
whom he came speedily to delight inhis fortune to restore and a sense of responsibility 
to that abstract thing society or public opinion as represented by those he knew or 
who knew him still there was this ache and this noncontrollable sense of adventure which 
freedom to contract a new matrimonial alliance or build his life on the plan he 
schemed with suzanne gave him suzanne suzannehow her face her gestures her voice haunted him 
not angela for all the pathos of her tragic ending but suzanne he thought of 
angela oftenthose last hours in the hospital her last commanding look which meant please look 
after our child and whenever he did so his vocal cords tightened as under the 
grip of a hand and his eyes threatened to overflow but even so and even 
then that undertow that mystic cord that seemed to pull from his solar plexus outward 
was to suzanne and to her only suzanne suzanne around her hair the thought of 
her smile her indescribable presence was built all that substance of romance which he had 
hoped to enjoy and which now in absence and probably final separation glowed with a 
radiance which no doubt the reality could never have had we are such stuff as 
dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep we are 
such stuff as dreams are made on and only of dreams are our keen stinging 
realities compounded nothing else is so moving so vital so painful as a dream for 
a time that first spring and summer while myrtle looked after little angela and eugene 
went to live with her and her husband he visited his old christian science practitioner 
mrs johns he had not been much impressed with the result in angela's case but 
myrtle explained the difficulty of the situation in a plausible way he was in a 
terrific state of depression and it was while he was so that myrtle persuaded him 
to go again she insisted that mrs johns would overcome his morbid gloom anyhow and 
make him feel better you want to come out of this eugene she pleaded you 
will never do anything until you do you are a big man life isn't over 
it's just begun you're going to get well and strong again don't worry everything that 
is is for the best he went once quarreling with himself for doing so for 
in spite of his great shocks or rather because of them he had no faith 
in religious conclusions of any kind angela had not been saved why should he still 
the metaphysical urge was somethingit was so hard to suffer spiritually and not believe there 
was some way out at times he hated suzanne for her indifference if ever she 
came back he would show her there would be no feeble urgings and pleadings the 
next time she had led him into this trap knowing well what she was doingfor 
she was wise enoughand then had lightly deserted him was that the action of a 
large spirit he asked himself would the wonderful something he thought he saw there be 
capable of that ah those hours at daleviewthat one stinging encounter in canadathe night she 
danced with him so wonderfully during a period of nearly three years all the vagaries 
and alterations which can possibly afflict a groping and morbid mind were his he went 
from what might be described as almost a belief in christian science to almost a 
belief that a devil ruled the world a gargantuan brobdingnagian mountebank who plotted tragedy for 
all ideals and rejoiced in swine and dullards and a grunting sweating beefy immorality by 
degrees his god if he could have been said to have had one in his 
consciousness sank back into a dual personality or a compound of good and evilthe most 
ideal and ascetic good as well as the most fantastic and swinish evil his god 
for a time at least was a god of storms and horrors as well as 
of serenities and perfections he then reached a state not of abnegation but of philosophic 
openmindedness or agnosticism he came to know that he did not know what to believe 
all apparently was permitted nothing fixed perhaps life loved only change equation drama laughter when 
in moments of private speculation or social argument he was prone to condemn it loudest 
he realized that at worst and at best it was beautiful artistic gay that however 
he might age groan complain withdraw wither still in spite of him this large thing 
which he at once loved and detested was sparkling on he might quarrel but it 
did not care he might fail or die but it could not he was negligiblebut 
oh the sting and delight of its inner shrines and favorable illusions and curiously for 
a time even while he was changing in this way he went back to see 
mrs johns principally because he liked her she seemed to be a motherly soul to 
him contributing some of the old atmosphere he had enjoyed in his own home in 
alexandria this woman from working constantly in the esoteric depths which mrs eddy's book suggests 
demonstrating for herself as she thought through her belief in or understanding of the oneness 
of the universe its nonmalicious affectionate control the nonexistence of fear pain disease and death 
itself had become so grounded in her faith that evil positively did not exist save 
in the belief of mortals that at times she almost convinced eugene that it was 
so he speculated long and deeply along these lines with her he had come to 
lean on her in his misery quite as a boy might on his mother the 
universe to her was as mrs eddy said spiritual not material and no wretched condition 
however seemingly powerful could hold against the truthcould gainsay divine harmony god was good all 
that is is god hence all that is is good or it is an illusion 
it could not be otherwise she looked at eugene's case as she had at many 
a similar one being sure in her earnest way that she by realizing his ultimate 
fundamental spirituality could bring him out of his illusions and make him see the real 
spirituality of things in which the world of flesh and desire had no part beloved 
she loved to quote to him now are we the sons of god and it 
doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall 
appearand she explained that he was this universal spirit of perfection of which we are 
a partwe shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and 
every man that has this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure 
she once explained to him that this did not mean that the man must purify 
himself by some hopeless moral struggle or emaciating abstinance but rather that the fact that 
he had this hope of something better in him would fortify him in spite of 
himself you laugh at me she said to him one day but i tell you 
you are a child of god there is a divine spark in you it must 
come out i know it will all this other thing will fall away as a 
bad dream it has no reality she even went so far in a sweet motherly 
way as to sing hymns to him and now strange to relate her thin voice 
was no longer irritating to him and her spirit made her seemingly beautiful in his 
eyes he did not try to adjust the curiosities and anomalies of material defects in 
so far as she was concerned the fact that her rooms were anything but artistically 
perfect that her body was shapeless or comparatively so when contrasted with that standard of 
which he had always been so conscious the fact that whales were accounted by her 
in some weird way as spiritual and bugs and torturesome insects of all kinds as 
emanations of mortal mind did not trouble him at all there was something in this 
thought of a spiritual universeof a kindly universe if you sought to make it so 
which pleased him the five senses certainly could not indicate the totality of things beyond 
them must lie depths upon depths of wonder and power why might not this act 
why might it not be good that book that he had once readthe world machinehad 
indicated this planetary life as being infinitesimally small that from the point of view of 
infinity it was not even thinkableand yet here it appeared to be so large why 
might it not be as carlyle had said a state of mind and as such 
so easily dissolvable these thoughts grew by degrees in force in power at the same 
time he was beginning to go out again a little a chance meeting with m 
charles who grasped his hand warmly and wanted to know where he was and what 
he was doing revived his old art fever m charles suggested with an air of 
extreme interest that he should get up another exhibition along whatever line he chose you 
he said with a touch of heartening sympathy and yet with a glow of fine 
corrective scorn for he considered eugene as an artist only and a very great one 
at that youeugene witlaan editora publisher pah youwho could have all the art lovers of 
the world at your feet in a few years if you choseyou who could do 
more for american art in your life time than anyone i know wasting your time 
art directing art editingpublishing pouf aren't you really ashamed of yourself but it isn't too 
late come nowa fine exhibition what do you say to an exhibition of some kind 
next january or february in the full swing of the season everybody's interested then i 
will give you our largest gallery how is that what do you say he glowed 
in a peculiarly frenchy wayhalf commanding half inspiring or exhorting if i can said eugene 
quietly with a deprecating wave of the hand and a faint line of selfscorn about 
the corners of his mouth it may be too late 'too late too late' what 
nonsense do you say that to me if you can if you can well i 
give you up you with your velvet textures and sure lines it is too much 
it is unbelievable he raised his hands eyes and eyebrows in gallic despair he shrugged 
his shoulders waiting to see a change of expression in eugene very good said eugene 
when he heard this only i can't promise anything we will see and he wrote 
out his address this started him once more the frenchman who had often heard him 
spoken of and had sold all his earlier pictures was convinced that there was money 
in himif not here then abroadmoney and some repute for himself as his sponsor some 
american artists must be encouragedsome must rise why not eugene here was one who really 
deserved it so eugene worked painting swiftly feverishly brilliantlywith a feeling half the time that 
his old art force had deserted him for evereverything that came into his mind taking 
a north lighted room near myrtle he essayed portraits of her and her husband of 
her and baby angela making arrangements which were classically simple then he chose models from 
the streetslaborers washerwomen drunkardscharacters all destroying canvases frequently but on the whole making steady progress 
he had a strange fever for painting life as he saw it for indicating it 
with exact portraits of itself strange grim presentations of its vagaries futilities commonplaces drolleries brutalities 
the mental fuzzywuzzy maunderings and meanderings of the mob fascinated him the paradox of a 
decaying drunkard placed against the vivid persistence of life gripped his fancy somehow it suggested 
himself hanging on fighting on accusing nature and it gave him great courage to do 
it this picture eventually sold for eighteen thousand dollars a record price in the meantime 
his lost dream in the shape of suzanne was traveling abroad with her motherin england 
scotland france egypt italy greece aroused by the astonishing storm which her sudden and uncertain 
fascination had brought on she was now so shaken and troubled by the disasters which 
had seemed to flow to eugene in her wake that she really did not know 
what to do or think she was still too young too nebulous she was strong 
enough in body and mind but very uncertain philosophically and morallya dreamer and opportunist her 
mother fearful of some headstrong destructive outburst in which her shrewdest calculations would prove of 
no avail was most anxious to be civil loving courteous politic anything to avoid a 
disturbing reencounter with the facts of the past or a sudden departure on the part 
of suzanne which she hourly feared what was she to do anything suzanne wantedher least 
whim her moods in dress pleasure travel friendship were most assiduously catered to would she 
like to go here would she like to see that would this amuse her would 
that be pleasant and suzanne seeing always what her mother's motives were and troubled by 
the pain and disgrace she had brought on eugene was uncertain now as to whether 
her conduct had been right or not she puzzled over it continually more terrifying however 
was the thought which came to her occasionally as to whether she had really loved 
eugene at all or not was this not a passing fancy had there not been 
some chemistry of the blood causing her to make a fool of herself without having 
any real basis in intellectual rapprochement was eugene truly the one man with whom she 
could have been happy was he not too adoring too headstrong too foolish and mistaken 
in his calculations was he the able person she had really fancied him to be 
would she not have come to dislike himto hate him evenin a short space of 
time could they have been truly permanently happy would she not be more interested in 
one who was sharp defiant indifferentone whom she could be compelled to adore and fight 
for rather than one who was constantly adoring her and needing her sympathy a strong 
solid courageous manwas not such a one her ideal after all and could eugene be 
said to be that these and other questions tormented her constantly it is strange but 
life is constantly presenting these pathetic paradoxesthese astounding blunders which temperament and blood moods bring 
about and reason and circumstance and convention condemn the dreams of man are one thinghis 
capacity to realize them another at either pole are the accidents of supreme failure and 
supreme successthe supreme failure of an abélard for instance the supreme success of a napoleon 
enthroned at paris but oh the endless failures for one success but in this instance 
it cannot be said that suzanne had definitely concluded that she did not love him 
far from it although the cleverest devices were resorted to by mrs dale to bring 
her into contact with younger and to hernowmore interesting personalities suzannevery much of an introspective 
dreamer and quiet spectator herself was not to be swiftly deluded by love againif she 
had been deluded she had half decided to study men from now on and use 
them if need be waiting for the time when some act of eugene's perhaps or 
some other personality might decide for her the strange destructive spell of her beauty began 
to interest her for now she knew that she really was beautiful she looked in 
her mirror very frequently nowat the artistry of a curl the curve of her chin 
her cheek her arm if ever she went back to eugene how well she would 
repay him for his agony but would she could she would he have not recovered 
his sanity and be able to snap his fingers in her face and smile superciliously 
for after all no doubt he was a wonderful man and would shine as something 
somewhere soon again and when he didwhat would he think of herher silence her desertion 
her moral cowardice after all i am not of much account she said to herself 
but what he thought of methat wild feverthat was wonderful really he was wonderful chapter 
xxix the dénouement of all this as much as ever could be was still two 
years off by that time suzanne was considerably more sobered somewhat more intellectually cultivated a 
little coolernot colder exactlyand somewhat more critical men when it came to her type of 
beauty were a little too suggestive of their amorousness after eugene their proffers of passion 
adoration undying love were not so significant but one day in new york on fifth 
avenue there was a reencounter she was shopping with her mother but their ways for 
a moment were divided by now eugene was once more in complete possession of his 
faculties the old ache had subsided to a dim but colorful mirage of beauty that 
was always in his eye often he had thought what he would do if he 
saw suzanne againwhat say if anything would he smile bowand if there were an answering 
light in her eye begin his old courtship all over or would he find her 
changed cold indifferent would he be indifferent sneering it would be hard on him perhaps 
afterwards but it would pay her out and serve her right if she really cared 
she ought to be made to suffer for being a waxy fool and tool in 
the hands of her mother he did not know that she had heard of his 
wife's deaththe birth of his childand that she had composed and destroyed five different letters 
being afraid of reprisal indifference scorn she had heard of his rise to fame as 
an artist once more for the exhibition had finally come about and with it great 
praise generous acknowledgments of his abilityartists admired him most of all they thought him strange 
eccentric but great m charles had suggested to a great bank director that his new 
bank in the financial district be decorated by eugene alone which was eventually donenine great 
panels in which he expressed deeply some of his feeling for life at washington in 
two of the great public buildings and in three state capitols were tall glowing panels 
also of his energetic dreaminga brooding suggestion of beauty that never was on land or 
sea here and there in them you might have been struck by a facean arm 
a cheek an eye if you had ever known suzanne as she was you would 
have known the basisthe fugitive spirit at the bottom of all these things but in 
spite of that he now hated heror told himself that he did under the heel 
of his intellectuality was the face the beauty that he adored he despised and yet 
loved it life had played him a vile tricklovethus to frenzy his reason and then 
to turn him out as mad now never again should love affect him and yet 
the beauty of woman was still his great lureonly he was the master and then 
one day suzanne appeared he scarcely recognized her so sudden it was and so quickly 
ended she was crossing fifth avenue at fortysecond street he was coming out of a 
jeweler's with a birthday ring for little angela then the eyes of this girl a 
pale looka flash of something wonderful that he remembered and then he stared curiouslynot quite 
sure he does not even recognize me thought suzanne or he hates me now ohall 
in five years it is she i believe he said to himself though i am 
not quite sure well if it is she can go to the devil his mouth 
hardened i will cut her as she deserves to be cut he thought she shall 
never know that i care and so they passednever to meet in this worldeach always 
wishing each defying each folding a wraith of beauty to the heart l'envoi there appears 
to be in metaphysics a basis or no basis according as the temperament and the 
experience of each shall incline him for ethical or spiritual ease or peace life sinks 
into the unknowable at every turn and only the temporary or historical scene remains as 
a guideand that passes also it may seem rather beside the mark that eugene in 
his moral and physical depression should have inclined to various religious abstrusities for a time 
but life does such things in a storm they constituted a refuge from himself from 
his doubts and despairs as religious thought always does if i were personally to define 
religion i would say that it is a bandage that man has invented to protect 
a soul made bloody by circumstance an envelope to pocket him from the unescapable and 
unstable illimitable we seek to think of things as permanent and see them so religion 
gives life a habitation and a name apparentlythough it is an illusion so we are 
brought back to time and space and illimitable mindas what and we shall always stand 
before them attributing to them all those things which we cannot know yet the need 
for religion is impermanent like all else in life as the soul regains its health 
it becomes prone to the old illusions again women entered his lifenever believe otherwisedrawn perhaps 
by a certain wistfulness and loneliness in eugene who though quieted by tragedy for a 
little while was once more moving in the world he saw their approach with more 
skepticism and yet not unmovedwomen who came through the drawing rooms to which he was 
invited wives and daughters who sought to interest him in themselves and would scarcely take 
no for an answer women of the stagewomen artists poetasters varietists critics dreamers from the 
many approaches letters and meetings some few relationships resulted ending as others had ended was 
he not changed then not muchno only hardened intellectually and emotionallytempered for life and work 
there were scenes too violent ones tears separations renouncements cold meetingswith little angela always to 
one side in myrtle's care as a stay and consolation in eugene one saw an 
artist who pagan to the core enjoyed reading the bible for its artistry of expression 
and schopenhauer nietzsche spinoza and james for the mystery of things which they suggested in 
his child he found a charming personality and a study as wellone whom he could 
brood over with affectionate interest at times seeing already something of himself and something of 
angela and wondering at the outcome what would she be like would art have any 
interest for her she was so daring gay selfwilled he thought you've a tartar on 
your hands myrtle once said to him and he smiled as he replied: just the 
same i'll see if i can't keep up with her one of his occasional thoughts 
was that if he and angela junior came to understand each other thoroughly and she 
did not marry too soon he could build a charming home around her perhaps her 
husband might not object to living with them the last scene of all may be 
taken from his studio in montclair where with myrtle and her husband as resident housekeepers 
and angela as his diversion he was living and working he was sitting in front 
of his fireplace one night reading when a thought in some history recalled to his 
mind a paragraph somewhere in spencer's astonishing chapters on the unknowable in his facts and 
comments and he arose to see if he could find it rummaging around in his 
books he extracted the volume and reread it with a kind of smack of intellectual 
agreement for it suited his mood in regard to life and his own mental state 
in particular because it was so peculiarly related to his own viewpoint i quote it: 
beyond the reach of our intelligence as are the mysteries of the objects known by 
our senses those presented in this universal matrix are if we may say so still 
further beyond the reach of our intelligence for whereas those of the one kind may 
be and are thought of by many as explicable on the hypothesis of creation and 
by the rest on the hypothesis of evolution those of the other kind cannot by 
either be regarded as thus explicable theist and agnostic must agree in recognizing the properties 
of space as inherent eternal uncreatedas anteceding all creation if creation has taken place hence 
could we penetrate the mysteries of existence there would still remain more transcendent mysteries that 
which can be thought of as neither made nor evolved presents us with facts the 
origin of which is even more remote from conceivability than is the origin of the 
facts presented by visible and tangible things the thought of this blank form of existence 
which explored in all directions as far as eye can reach has beyond that an 
unexplored region compared with which the part imagination has traversed is but infinitesimalthe thought of 
a space compared with which our immeasurable sidereal system dwindles to a point is a 
thought too overwhelming to be dwelt upon of late years the consciousness that without origin 
or cause infinite space has ever existed and must ever exist produces in me a 
feeling from which i shrink well said eugene turning as he thought he heard a 
slight noise that is certainly the sanest interpretation of the limitations of human thought i 
have ever readand then seeing the tiny angela enter clad in a baggy little sleeping 
suit which was not unrelated to a harlequin costume he smiled for he knew her 
wheedling shifty moods and tricks now what are you coming in here for he asked 
with mock severity you know you oughn't to be up so late if auntie myrtle 
catches you but i can't sleep daddy she replied trickily anxious to be with him 
a little while longer before the fire and tripping coaxingly across the floor won't you 
take me yes i know all about your not being able to sleep you scamp 
you're coming in here to be cuddled you beat it oh no daddy all right 
then come here and he gathered her up in his arms and reseated himself by 
the fire now you go to sleep or back you go to bed she snuggled 
down her yellow head in his crook'd elbow while he looked at her cheek recalling 
the storm in which she had arrived little flower girl he said sweet little kiddie 
his offspring made no reply presently he carried her asleep to her couch tucked her 
in and coming back went out on the brown lawn where a late november wind 
rustled in the still clinging brown leaves overhead were the starorion's majestic belt and those 
mystic constellations that make dippers bears and that remote cloudy formation known as the milky 
way where in all thisin substance he thought rubbing his hand through his hair is 
angela where in substance will be that which is me what a sweet welter life 
ishow rich how tender how grim how like a colorful symphony great art dreams welled 
up into his soul as he viewed the sparkling deeps of space the sound of 
the windhow fine it is tonight he thought then he went quietly in and closed
